
Why does it seem that everyone with a 'normal' job has the day off? Arsenal Tweets now following me. Best beware what I say about Arsenal...
At Arsenal training ahead of today's press conference. Arsene Wenger has had long chats with Adebayor and Bendtner. Interesting...
Arsenal so short of numbers that youth teamer Conor McCormack joins the group. Not involved tomorrow though...
Chelsea v Liverpool. A classic - what a game. Arsenal have a lot to live up to on Weds night!
Arsenal previews from the training ground tomorrow... Wenger's running out of players!
Just about to watch Arsenal train... Hoping for some good team news!
Up early for Setanta Sports newspaper review. Big day for Theo and Co but they're confident. Arsenal could've signed Drogba for 100k!
"Arsenal: fabianski, eboue, toure, silvestre, gibbs, theo, denilson, cesc, diaby, rvp, adebayor. Risky..."
"Didier Drogba gets the better of Arsenal. Again. Fair result though, I think.think"
Adebayor rested for Arsenal at Liverpool tomorrow
"Looking forward to Liverpool v Arsenal tonight. Draw, me thinks..."
Arsenal press conference tomorrow. Stay tuned for an update after lunch...
I wouldn't have given Arsenal much chance against Man United two weeks ago. But now... It's going to be a classic...
Arsenal got away with it. Tie should be over.
"Silent Stan buys about 50m worth of shares, making him the main shareholder of Arsenal with 28 per cent. Yankee Doodle Dandy"
Arsenal's second string humiliated Portsmouth who were so poor. They'll be relegated next season.
"At Arsenal training. RvP trains, major boost..."
Arsenal thoroughly beaten over two legs. Illustrates a huge gulf between Arsenal and United. Wenger needs more experience like Arshavin.
"Arsenal need players. Wenger must buy a centre half, central midfielder and replacement for Ade$&?@r."
@djamesc gotta replace Adebayor if Arsenal wanna challenge. Can't believe Chelsea would be keen if they'd watched him this season
Cesc Fabregas pledges his future to Arsenal. Now Arsenal need to dig deep to challenge next season. Three big players required. #Arsenal
"Was told Arsenal after player who plays in France, isn't French and had great season. Thought may be Sakho but he's French. Ideas? #arsenal"
"I don't understand footballers. Four days after pledging his loyalty to Arsenal, Cesc says an offer from Barca would be 'special.' #arsenal"
A difference in loyalty. Clichy dismisses Real Madrid interest. Sagna 'wouldn't be against it.' Clichy's commitment underlined. #arsenal
Cesc pledges future to Arsenal. How significant was it making him captain? He must be desperate for a big season. #arsenal
After thought on cesc. Next time a Spanish journalist asks about Real Madrid... Dodge it! Makes life easier. #arsenal
"Big, big test for Theo Walcott. Can he be England's main man against Germany tonight? #arsenal"
Met Arsenal fan 2nite who lost the tops of both index fingers trying to jump over a fence after losing to Chelsea at wembley. Urgh! #arsenal
"Biggest hit on Mirror website today was Ade story
http://bit.ly/DAYxz

#arsenal"
Usmanov's offer to inject millions into Arsenal to reduce debt and give Wenger SERIOUS money to spend is rejected by board. #arsenal
City give up on Eto'o. Will they now turn to Adebayor? A similar mercenary. #arsenal #man city
Gr8 contrast between way Arsenal treat Kroenke and Usmanov. Usmanov frozen out. Kroenke will launch full takeover bid within year. #arsenal
Don't think Man City will have any probs persuading Adebayor to give up Champs Lge football. Show me the money! #arsenal #man city #adebayor
@Rukz0304 Hi. Thanks so much 4 yr tweet! I agree - Arsenal always take so long over deals/contracts. I do think Arse have got Chamakh tho
Chamakh will be great replacement for Ade. Rarely have I known Arsenal fans so excited about selling a player - hope 4 u all Ade goes asap
"@JoePescii Hi. I try to be neutral - and with my twitter! Sorry. People always guess wrong. Spurs think I'm Arsenal, Arsenal think I'm Spurs"
Chelsea strongly denying any interest in Adebayor - a story floating around in one or two of tomorrow's English papers. #adebayor #arsenal
Adebayor desperate for Milan or another club to come in. That should serve as a warning to #mancity Arsenal desperate to sell #arsenal
@Neil_Ashton About as popular as an Arsenal/Adebayor shirt! How's KL?
Have never had so many gleeful messages about Adebayor going. A very popular departure. Don't criticise Arsenal for selling him. #arsenal
"Adebayor: My first choice was Man City. Sums the guy up. A joker. City fans - sorry, but he ain't the real deal. #arsenal #mancity"
"At Four Seasons hotel, Beverley Hills. Mourinho, Vieira and Klinsmann in the foyer. Bit star struck. #arsenal #Chelsea #spurs"
"Rarely do footballers surprise u. Adebayor takes biscuit. Poor £80,000-a-week says the fans ""were not nice at all."" Ah, diddums. #arsenal"
"@MartinL2828 I'm doing the pre-season tour but am based in London so do Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham etc. London football basically."
Man City turn to Kolo Toure after missing out on John Terry. City ready to do a £12m deal. Could open door for Hangeland & Arsenal. #arsenal
"Vieira back to Arsenal would be masterstroke. At 33, PV can no longer scale the heights but would be great for the dressing room. #arsenal"
Can't believe bloggers taking Wenger seriously about no more signings. A genius but proven liar on transfers. Does it every window. #arsenal
There'll be signings. AW doesn't want 2 let people know he's buying or prices go up. People still take him at face value. Naive. #arsenal
"Right. Gonna stop talking about Vieira now! Arsenal need character/s. No, really... Gonna stop!"
PlusMarket announces shift in shares... Fiszman to Kroenke. Stan's takeover edges ever closer. He'll be main man by next year. #arsenal
Wenger dropping big hints today that Vieira could return... And Chamakh appears to be underway. #arsenal
Arshavin scores. 1-0. Russian genius. #arsenal
Just imagine Arshavin and Vieira... 1-1 by the way... #arsenal
2-1 arshavin!!! Crazy. #arsenal
"Senderos to Everton, Chamakh to Arsenal, Lescott to City. Things hotting up! #arsenal #everton #mancity"
Will Rosicky ever get back to what he was..? I doubt it. Terrific player at his peak. #arsenal
"Sorry, Celtic. But can only see one winner: Arsenal. Gap is growing. Wenger will be happy, Mowbray depressed. #arsenal #Celtic"
Djourou's injury plus other knocks shows how threadbare Arsenal squad is. Don't expect any trophies without more signings. #arsenal
Dubious as to whether Arsenal have pulled out of Chamakh. They don't wanna pay 8m - even tho their ticket prices are sky high! #arsenal
@Rotimi_Kuforiji Still think he's no1. That Arsenal thing 'we won't pay big fees - but charge fans loads to watch cheap players' amazes me
"Arsenal fans remember: Wenger nvr does business early. Drives late, hard deals. Chamakh, Hangeland, Vieira, Matuidi still in frame. #arsenal"
How many times did Wenger try to bluff  that Arshavin deal was off?! Don't be fooled. He still wants Chamakh - just at right price. #arsenal
Most interesting thing from Wenger's interview on Times' website...? That his favourite film is The Deer Hunter. A classic movie. #arsenal
Off to #Portsmouth v #Fulham. I fear for Pompey - could go down. Fulham need to keep Hangeland but #arsenal hovering. Score draw at Fratton
Hangeland has made 2 great blocks for #Fulham. But his distribution is appalling. Is he a 12m player? No. Is he an #Arsenal type player? No
@dJfLiCkY I think it's more likely he'll stay at Fulham. Arsenal don't want to pay 12m plus.
#Arsenal undoubtedly had result of weekend. But #mancity also showed they mean business. Drogba showed he's back for #Chelsea. Tight race
"Off to Glasgow Monday. Follow my tweets for team news, gossip, press conference, preview etc for #Celtic vs #Arsenal"
"Just landed in Glasgow. BMI have succeeded in opening my bag, losing my luggage tag and thoroughly annoying me. Press con afta 4. #arsenal"
"Rare I moan about newspaper coverage, but should mention that 2 teams played at Goodison. Not just Everton. #Arsenal deserve more praise."
Arsene Wenger in confident mood at press conference. He believes Arsenal's spirit will help them through Celtic cauldron. #arsenal
Arsenal without Theo after Walcott suffers injury setback. Diaby fit and I think he may start. #arsenal
Mowbray love in with Wenger. Celtic boss full of praise for him. No English team has won at Celtic since Forest 26 yrs ago. #arsenal
"My debut at #Celtic Park - what a noise! #Arsenal came through. Vermaelen, Song, Cesc outstanding. They're showing promise for season..."
"Off to #Arsenal press conference today,  to see Arsene Wenger for all the news ahead of Portsmouth game. I'll tweet so stay tuned! #Arsenal"
"Eduardo is back in the squad - and may start. Wenger ""rubbishes"" latest Cesc/Barca stories. Wenger also bigging up Song's progress. #arsenal"
"Theo out for next 2 weeks and next #England WC qualifier. Wenger upset Walcott went to under-21s. ""England will pay price."" #Arsenal"
Good interview with Gael Clichy in Sat Mirror/web. He hails importance of Wenger and desire to win trophy this season. Next #Arsenal captain
Wenger admits he's still interested in Vieira. 'Until Aug 31 it's still possible.' Also wants a defender. May get Matuidi too. #arsenal
I still think Chamakh is on Wenger radar despite denials. He also dismissed Arshavin rumours in Jan and look what happened... #arsenal
@brainopops Arsenal v Portsmouth. It's such an obvious result - that Pompey might cause an upset! What are you up to?
Am off to #Arsenal v #Portsmouth today. It's such an obvious home win that I reckon there just be a surprise...
"Wenger rests Song, Sagna, Clichy and Bendtner. Gibbs, Eboue, Diaby and Eduardo all in. Bit of a gamble. Draw on cards... #arsenal"
"Great win for #Arsenal, shame Cesc limped off with hammy. Could be worse - could be #Portsmouth. Takeover turmoil and fans deserve better"
Arsenal training and press conference on Tues morning. Please follow the build up to the #Celtic game. #Arsenal
Cesc Fabregas misses training - major blow. Out for #celtic and #manunited on saturday and up to 3 weeks. But Rosicky trains. #Arsenal
"Wenger talking after 12. Follow press con on my twitter and at wwwmmirrorfootball.co.uk
#arsenal"
"Wenger gives Cesc chance of being fit for #manunited, says #Celtic job 'not done' and shock at Sol. Read at mirrorfootball website. #arsenal"
"Wenger says if Senderos goes then he will replace him. If not, Senderos will rejoin the first team. Think PS wants fresh start. #arsenal"
Wenger hails sharper RvP. #Arsenal are genuine CL contenders. Says it's 'vital' they reach Group stages. Read MirrorFootball site/paper
Champs League Group stages may open door for new signings. But Senderos departure will hold key. Mirrorfootball website/ paper. #arsenal
Off to #Arsenal v #Celtic. Me thinks 2-1 home win. Follow me through the game...
"Wenger: This game's bigger than  Man U. Er, van Persie and Arshavin left on bench. Eduardo, Eboue start in 4-4-2. #Arsenal should still win"
"Distin set for £4m #Everton switch... That's no-go to Ev for Senderos. Villa, Sunderland, Fulham and one other watching Philippe... #arsenal"
"My Thursday column on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
I'll be writing on O'Neill and Villa fans, Wenger's new #Arsenal tactic, Harry & Sol. #spurs"
Amazing miss by Eduardo. 0-0 and 10 gone. #arsenal
"Celtic in these shirts look like Borussia Dortmund! Arsenal have started well, Gallas in the mood. #arsenal"
Eduardo - had to be a dive! Penalty! Eduardo scores 1-0. #arsenal
Stewards getting busy with Celtic shirts in home end. Shame they don't get busy with offensive chanting... #arsenal
"Gallas in brilliant form, loving his forays forward. Arsenal playing with great confidence. Watch out #manunited. Still 1-0. #arsenal"
Arsenal 1 up at half time thanks to Eduardo's dodgy pen. 3-0 on agg. Cruise control. #arsenal
Andy Townsend called Eduardo a 'cheat' on ITV. Tomorrow's headlines may not be too pleasant for Eduardo. Hard to defend that. #arsenal
"Eboue 2-0. Then booked for putting his Arsenal shirt above his head. Religious T shirt or not, a stupid yellow card. #arsenal"
Arsenal 3-0 after sub Arshavin magic. Easy street. Let you know what Wenger says later. Will he have seen Eduardo's dive?! #arsenal
"Ramsey limps off with 5 to go. #Arsenal had used all 3 subs, down to ten men. They could have played 90 mins with ten men and still won..."
"All over. Arsenal 3 (Eduardo pen 26, Eboue 53, Arshavin 74) Celtic 1 (Donati 90) 5-1 agg. Gallas mom. #Arsenal confident for #manunited."
Donati's injury time strike an absolute peach! #Arsenal thru to Thurs draw. What price #manunited v Ronaldo? All 4 English clubs top seeds
"Wenger defends Eduardo, claiming he didn't dive. Celtic incensed. Headlines won't make pleasant reading for Eduardo in morning. #arsenal"
#Arsenal fans are looking for excuses for Eduardo. He dived - end of story. Sometimes it's sporting and better to admit it!
@farrukhx Ronaldo dive at Bolton last yr. Styles apologised. Ronaldo got slaughtered. No anti-Arsenal bias. U just follow AFC stories closer
@arseblog Pundits slaughtered for diving at Bolton last Sept. Got even more coverage than Eduardo. Selective memories. No anti-Arsenal bias
"Pls remember: Every Arsenal fan thinking I'm slaughtering Eduardo - Spurs fans think I hate 'em too. And Chelsea, West Ham etc. No bias here"
AZ Alkmaar in with Arsenal. Arsene will be happy. Bet he saw that one...
"Olympiakos go in with AZ Alkmaar and Arsenal. Wenger will be laughing. Easy street. Last group - Milan, Real Madrid and Marseille"
Arsenal get Standard Liege. So that's Alkmaar and Olympiakos. I saw Arsenal thrash Standard Liege in Belgium a few years back....
Quick quiz question... Which Republic of Ireland international scored for Arsenal that night when Arsenal won 7-0 if my memory serves me...
"United have got Moscow, Besiktas and Wolfsburg. Beware United - Wolfsburg striker Dzeko is brilliant. Arsenal wanted him but out of range"
Arsenal and Chelsea will be happiest. Really tough for Liverpool. United will get through but hard games for Fergie. Fancy all 4 to get thru
@Aphiss They showed Arsenal reps as soon as they were out of the hat. But just no-one recognises them! See - it's that paranoia again...
"Fabregas hoping to train, hoping to be fit, would be major boost for #Arsenal. Would be great to see full strength #Arsenal and a classic."
Wow. Wenger really goes for UEFA. He's right. If UEFA go for Eduardo - they must show consistency and go for every diver & cheat. #arsenal
Disappointing for #Arsenal that Wenger has ruled out Cesc. Diaby has huge potential - but needs to start showing it! Draw me thinks.
Dear oh dear Diaby. Hard to believe #Arsenal played so well and lost. Wenger then sent off. No common sense. Major boost for #manunited
MotD didn't ask Wenger about his sending off or pen decisions! Incredible. How many years is it now Weng has said #Arsenal lack experience?!
"Still think Wenger will look to do one last deal for #Arsenal. Vieira, Chamakh or a c/ half. But Senderos still there despite everything..."
My word... UEFA have opened a can of worms! And what will #Celtic players say about McGeady's sending off? Consistency please! #Arsenal
Adebayor praises #mancity fans for their support. Don't be fooled. It won't last. #Arsenal fans saw right through him.
"Manuel Almunia is here at # England training at London Colney. Wearing an #Arsenal top and on a different pitch, mind you!"
"My online column at www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
Also on those vile Wenger chants - gotta stop it. #arsenal"
#England striker Wayne Rooney also on his big year for #manunited and country. Plus his views on diving. #Arsenal fans won't like it!
"Good to see #Arsenal spending their huge, er, wealth... No 7 in football rich list - what's all that about?"
"Fergie enters diving row with common sense and backing for new pal Wenger, saying every boss backs their players, even cheats. #arsenal"
"Swedish press is awash with Freddie Ljungberg coming back to #Arsenal this winter...  Just to train during MLS break at best, me thinks"
@DanSilverMirror Am afraid there's no chance of him wearing an Arsenal shirt! Just in his dreams... Shall I twitter from Wembley?
Even if Usmanov buys Nina's shares it's non-starter cos other shareholders won't sell. Then has to sell back at top rate. A no-go. #arsenal
Wenger gonna regret not buying now Djourou out for six months. Major blow. #Arsenal really short of defensive cover and have thin squad
"At #England training at #Arsenal training grnd. Fabio on his mobile, Wenger waved at me, Nasri walking freely no plastercast, Walcott back."
"#Arsenal hoping Walcott back in squad for Sat, possibly starting in the Champs League. He's got task on his hands to win back Eng place"
Great games today. #mancity v #arsenal then #spurs v #manunited. Latter always a cracker. Fancy spurs more likely to crack top four
"Sounds like the FA will come down harder on Adebayor for the alleged stamp on RvP than the celebration. Bad, bad day for #Arsenal."
Just watched #Adebayor celebration for 15th time and it gets madder every time! He never put that effort in once last season for #Arsenal !
"As for #Adebayor alleged stamp on RvP... Just shocking. Gotta be a long, long ban. He's trouble with a capital T. #Arsenal"
"Saw Chiles, Keown, Dixon at Fulham. Bit of an #Arsenal feel to MotD2 tonight maybe?"
A remarkable decision by UEFA on Eduardo. The biggest U-turn in the history of the European game. Eduardo can now play v Liege. #Arsenal
"Van persie, almunia, denilson all out for liege. Manone in goal. #arsenal"
"Strong words from Wenger on Adebayor in build up to Liege game. #Arsenal need a result. RvP, Denilson, Walcott, Almunia out. Mannone starts"
Check out Standard Liege midfielder Axel Witsel. Banned for 8games for horror Eduardo style tackle but plays in CL v #Arsenal. Priorities..
Standard Liege have problems too. Defour is their best player and he's out injured. So still expect #Arsenal to get a result.
Amazing #Arsenal stat. Almunia has saved just 53percent of shots on target this season. Or he's let in half shots on goal. Bring on Mannone!
#Arsenal take big gamble on starting with Rosicky - his first start since Jan 2008. Sagna drops to bench. Dropped?
Cruel irony of Eduardo making a Sunday League mistake and then a stupid penalty. 0-2 #Arsenal see European ambitions put in perspective
#Arsenal got away with it tonight after woeful first half. Written in the stars that Eduardo would score the winner. Wenger hails spirit.
"Seen the Fabregas scars up close and they look really, really bad. Sorry but it makes Adebayor's excuses this morning seem a joke. #Arsenal"
Adebayor misguided if he thinks #Arsenal fans are upset because he was sold. More to do with not trying last season etc! Such arrogance
"Much made of #Arsenal fans singing bad songs to Ade at City. Ad I understand it, song was Arshavin version rather than elephants. Correct?"
Off to #Arsenal press conference will update on team news later...
RvP returns for #Arsenal. Almunia still out so Mannone. Walcott has had a setback and is still out.
Wenger admitted he'd be interested in signing Chamakh in Jan as well as saying Senderos will def start vs WBA on Tues. #Arsenal
Wenger praises Eboue 9months on from Wigan nightmare. Eboue has turned things around at #Arsenal. But still plenty of room for improvement
"Off to #Arsenal v #Wigan and then #Chelsea v #Spurs. Fancy Arsenal and Chelsea, but wouldn't be surprised if Spurs nick a point tomorrow"
"#Arsenal 1 #Wigan 0. Vermaelen header 25 mins. Arsenal better team, but goal came at right time."
#Arsenal 2-0 Vermaelen again. Cracker. Has been a great signing.
"3-0 eduardo, easy street for #Arsenal"
"Eboue given 3rd after deflection. #Arsenal 3 #Wigan 0. Booed a year ago, Eboue hero today. Vermaelen outstanding, RvP v good. Rosicky on"
Beautiful goal by Fabregas. 4-0 to #Arsenal. #Wigan boss Martinez practically surrendered b4 game by writing off games vs top 4
Can't think of a more frustrating player than Abou Diaby? Hugely talented but either can't be bothered or is off form most weeks. #arsenal
"Great stuff from Thierry on Adebayor in Sunday Mirror. Ade could learn so much from Henry, a genuine world class player and #Arsenal legend"
"Senderos makes his comeback for #Arsenal v WBA in Carling Cup. 16 month absence, thought he was going this summer - deserves good reception"
"Di Matteo blamed Wilshire for Thomas sending off. Vela made all the difference for #Arsenal. Wenger said of Vela: ""He's class."""
Think there's more chance of Adebayor going back to #Arsenal than #Spurs signing Sol.
Arshavin and Walcott return for #Arsenal squad for trip to Fulham. Almunia still out. Wenger hinted Szczesny may start ahead of Mannone.
"Wenger also hit back at Bordeaux president Triaud claims that #Arsenal tapped up Chamakh. ""I can look at myself in the mirror."""
"RvP is telling the truth. Strikers take a nudge, they go down. It's different from diving. He was honest, he doesn't deserve flak. #Arsenal"
Don't think we'll see Theo today. Shame. Maybe bench on Tues. Think Wenger is holding him back too long. He's fit and raring to go! #arsenal
Off to Craven Cottage now for #Fulham v #Arsenal. Think Arsenal may get frustrated again. But maybe they will get a point off Fulham
#Arsenal 1-0 rvp winner. Mannone man of match. #Fulham fans give their team standing ovation. Great support.
I'm off to #Arsenal press conference this morning and will have latest team news ahead of #Olympiakos. Check back late morning and lunchtime
Why on earth is Mart Poom at #Arsenal training ground? Goalkeeping crisis takes a new twist...
No Almunia again but Walcott is out there training. 21 players training today. Senderos is there as is Wilshere. Wenger talks l8r. #arsenal
"Denilson out for 2 months, Bendtner and Walcott also miss Olympiakos. #Arsenal"
On Talksport now - lots of #Arsenal chat! #Liverpool too
"Wenger: I've got cash, but don't wanna spend it! Misguided skinflint or genius? Surely they can't win title. Yr thoughts pls! #Arsenal"
"Wenger overtakes George Allison as longest serving #Arsenal boss on Thursday. But Wenger admits: This is pivotal season for ""my policy"""
Comfortable 2-0 win for #Arsenal in the end. Can't be many better bargains than RvP. But Arsenal went back to trying to walk it into net...
"@arseblog I think it's a big season, I really do. Wenger seemed to accept that when he spoke with us on Mon. Think Arsenal need more quality"
"Got Wenger's transfer policy in my sights for my online column tomorrow at www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
Great #Arsenal boss, but big year"
Don't underestimate Kroenke's latest share buying. All about positioning for takeover. He'll be next owner of #Arsenal
@BadbeatGooner He's frugal in his other sports so he won't be a sugar daddy. I like the tradition of Arsenal but times are achanging
Off to #Arsenal training ground for presser at lunchtime. Let you know latest team news...
"Wenger says Henry will return to #Arsenal one day after he retires from playing. Mannone stays in goal on Sunday, Walcott and Bendtner back"
"Big call by Wenger putting Arshavin in same bracket as Messi & Ronaldo. Says Arshavin can be all time gr8.
www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
#Arsenal"
Fabregas got my first ever 10/10 rating. Amazing display for #Arsenal. But why on earth do so many people leave so early? Stay and applaud!
"Easy for #Arsenal, 2-0 up after 18mins thru RvP and Diaby. Song great ball for first, Diaby finally wakes up for second. #Birmingham poor"
"Easy for #Arsenal, 2-0 up after 18mins. RvP with first, Diaby with second. Song set up first with great ball, even Diaby in mood! Brum poor"
"Walcott limps off after 32mins, following early clattering by Ridgewell. Arshavin on for #Arsenal. Walcott getting no luck with injuries"
"#Arsenal have taken foot off gas, could be edgy last 15mins as #Birmingham have brought on McSheffrey and O'Connor. Still 2-1"
Arshavin makes it 3-1 to #Arsenal. They've made meal of it but the Russian is a genius
Top quality gesture by #Arsenal fans - inc RedAction - to hold up number 4s in support of Cesc on Sat after his grandad's illness. Well done
"Flying out to Holland with #Arsenal today. Latest team news just afta lunch. Then Amsterdam tonight, Alkmaar tomorrow. Hope Wenger on form.."
Bad news for Theo Walcott and #Arsenal. Our for up to three weeks with knee injury. Could miss #England too. Told he doesn't blame Ridgewell
Rosicky also missing for #Arsenal in Alkmaar. Should be back for weekend. Walcott ruled out for up to 4 weeks - & out of England - by Wenger
Read Wenger's views on #Arsenal and his future at www.mirrorfootball.co.uk later and in tomorrow's Mirror. Now for Amsterdam...
"Bit surprised Wenger kept faith Mannone for #Arsenal. Almunia hasn't been gr8 this season, but Mannone is a worry. Hope he comes thru 2nite"
"#Arsenal deserve to be 1-0 up, sloppy at times, but Fabregas's goal was sheer quality. Arshavin is brilliant to watch. A genius."
"Wenger unhappy with #Arsenal's defending after conceding last gasp leveller to AZ Alkmaar.1-1. Straight home, then Talksport breakfast show!"
"Shame a wonderful Total Football goal from Fabregas didn't end in #Arsenal win. Arshavin was brilliant. Flying home with team,they are down."
How will Wenger spend his 60th birthday? He didn't fly back with the #Arsenal team as he went off to watch another game on Weds. Continued..
"Cont... Wakes up alone, then flies back to AGM and then Europa League on TV in the evening... It's all glamour for #Arsenal boss. Legend."
"#Arsenal AGM. Hill-Wood's bizarre display, AW hero reception, Gunnersaurus' Jersey link, Silent Stan stays silent http://tinyurl.com/ylfb8r5"

"#Arsenal AGM. Closely followed by... Does Gunnersaurus go on tour? Hill-Wood: I'm told he was in Chernobyl, you remember that nuclear place"
Surreal stuff from the #Arsenal AGM. Very odd questions. So next time you have a go at journalists for not asking the right things...!
Another interesting thing from #Arsenal AGM - Wenger's fierce defence of his keepers. He's happy with keepers and doesn't need to buy. Mmm..
"At #Arsenal press conference - so check back for team news. Then #Arsenal TV Online later, live from 8.15pm with Tom Watt and Charlie George"
"#Arsenal boss Wenger in good mood at presser. Mixed injury news: Rosicky out, Bendtner faces test, Eduardo returns. Weng praises Zola"
Don't miss #Arsenal TV tonight. On Fans Forum live from 8.15pm.
Off to #WestHam v #Arsenal shortly. Gonna take in #Liverpool v #ManUnited. Draw at Anfield. Difficult away win at Upton Park.
#WestHam fought and deserve credit. #Arsenal collapsed. Why on earth did Wenger stick with Mannone?! When will he buy a top keeper? Too late
Easy street for #Tottenham as they beat #Everton 2-0. Bentley man of match for #Spurs. A year ago since his wonder goal at #Arsenal
"So who is #Arsenal's number one? 
Almunia, Fabianski, Mannone or Szczesny. Almunia may have lost his no1 status

Reckon Almunia back for Sat. And an old adversary whipping up things before then... Promises to be a cracker: #Arsenal v #Spurs
Fair to say Wenger doesn't agree with Robbie Keane that #Spurs are on a par with #Arsenal. Noticeable Wenger didn't exactly praise Harry...
"Wenger admitted: ""I am always tempted to recall Almunia."" Looks like Manuel has waited long enough to return for #Arsenal"
Manuel Almunia is back in goal for #Arsenal v #Spurs. Time for experience and Almunia is better than Vito. Still think it'll be a draw tho
Manuel Almunia back for #Arsenal. U read it here first yesterday and in Mirror Sport
#Arsenal away to Man City. Adebayor revenge! #Tottenham at #ManUnited. Blackburn v Chelsea and Portsmouth v Villa. Carling cup quarters
#Arsenal excellent. Van Persie was a thorn in Spurs' side all game. But Vermaelen was brilliant at back. Almunia comes back with clean sheet
Gr8 quote from Wenger as he lost his rag during #Arsenal win. 'I couldn't communicate with players because of noise. I'm not used to that!'

Rosicky is back in training for #Arsenal. Pat Rice pulling Rosicky's leg that he's finally fit. Eboue smiling for the cameras!
Wenger just had long chat with Senderos at #Arsenal training. Interesting... Bendtner may need surgery on his groin and def out for 4 weeks
#Arsenal defender Gael Clichy facing lengthy lay off with stress fracture in his back. Major blow. Gibbs comes in
"Wenger relaxed about Kroenke's latest share purchase. As long as he does not interfere, the #Arsenal manager is ok with silent Stan"
Sky tried out their new 3D technology at #Arsenal reserves' defeat to Portsmouth on Monday night. Hope the 2 goals didn't look too bad in 3D

Wilshere dropping deep again in midfield for #Arsenal. Almost 4-3-2-1. #Bolton striker Davies just won his first header against Koscielny...
AA23 just missed one on one after great ball by Rosicky. #Arsenal denied by super save from Bogdan
Davies booked after 18 mins for foul on Wilshere. #Arsenal boss Wenger said yesterday Davies 'is not a dirty player.' Not good on replay...
Hit and miss for Koscielny so far - today and in general. His fault as Bolton level through Elmander. Very poor defending from #Arsenal. 1-1
New style boxes for h/t fish and chips in #Arsenal press room. U get more chips now. Koscielny may not get battered (get it?) after all...
"Ball flew into the #Arsenal crowd, fan headed it spectacularly back onto the pitch before taking a bow. Take note Koscielny!"

Big test for Djourou. He's earned the chance but must take it vs #Chelsea #CFC bogeyman Drogba. 13 in 13 v #Arsenal. CFC won last 5 v Arse
"Still waiting for game to catch light. #Arsenal playing some nice stuff, #Chelsea dangerous on counter attack. Haven't we been here before?"

#Arsenal 3 up and in charge. Rarely do you see #Chelsea as poor as this and taken apart like this. Now #Arsenal must believe
Take your pick of the songs from #Arsenal fans. 'Ashley what's the score?' 'Sacked in morning' at #Chelsea boss Ancelotti. 3-1 Ivanovic

Diaby on for Walcott. Walcott been a menace for #Arsenal. #Chelsea will be pleased to see back of him. Maybe Wenger wants to tighten up
Fabregas comes off to standing ovation from #Arsenal fans. That mental block about his hamstring been blown away tonight.
#Arsenal been excellent. This should be - if they hold on - the win that makes them believe they can be champions. A huge win for Wenger
#Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere having pics aplenty with fans near tunnel area. And here comes AP McCoy with his BBC gong. Here's Gilberto

"Wow! World class from Arshavin, amazing technique. #Arsenal 1-1 #Wigan. AA23 at his best - he needs to show that more often"
Brilliant finish by Bendtner. Supply line from AA23. That sort of finish justifies Bendtner's self belief. #Arsenal 2-1 up and playing well
Rewind to end of last season and #Arsenal's aerial weaknesses exposed again by #Wigan. A commanding centre half clears that. Here's Theo
#Arsenal should have this in bag but #Wigan shown great spirit. Thrilling finish now. 2-2
"That was handball, surely? Should have been a penalty to #Arsenal. Thomas handled Nasri free kick ala Cesc v #Spurs. Refs=inconsistent. 2-2"
"8 changes cost #Arsenal dear. 2-2 at #Wigan. In title terms, bad, bad night for Wenger whose gamble backfired. Bigger problems at #LFC..."
Get the feeling Wenger will be unhappy over 2 penalty decisions which look to have cost #Arsenal. 2-2
"No 2 games in 3 days excuses, please. It's what we do in England and we love it. #Arsenal blown big chance, albeit 2 bad decisions cost dear"

"#Arsenal v #Stoke preview: http://tinyurl.com/62oaj9u In paper news on summer tour. Pizza & Twitter loving #AFC player. OK, I'm guilty, too"
Cesc and Wenger in programme notes stressing the need for good #Arsenal win 2night to set up Carling Cup final. #Stoke will have other ideas
#Arsenal v #Stoke team sheet. Got the #AFC team right. For a change... http://twitpic.com/42zsdq
Nice way to answer some critics (including me) as Squillaci puts #Arsenal ahead. 1-0. #AFC started really well.
Seriously bad news here for #Arsenal as Cesc is struggling. Arshavin stripped and ready to come on.
Terrible news for #Arsenal as Fabregas comes off. Looked like a knee problem. Just days ahead of Cup final. Here's AA23
The whole place has been rather dumbstruck by Cesc injury. #Stoke went close through Carew but #Arsenal keeper Szczesny made great save 1-0
"#Arsenal started quickly, deserved Squillaci lead 1-0. Cesc injury taken wind out of their sails. #Stoke Carew forced top save from Szczesny"
#Arsenal suffer another major injury blow as Walcott stretchered off. Winning but at a price and #Stoke still in it. 1-0
Victory but at what cost to #Arsenal? Nasty challenges in there and Wenger left licking his wounds. #Stoke made fight of it 2nd half.1-0 f/t
"Double blow for #Arsenal. Theo sprained ankle, misses final. Cesc hamstring assessed Thurs"
Bruising for #Arsenal but Wenger had no complaints and was smiling rather than grimacing. Wenger praised #Stoke 'spirit and intelligence'
Exclusive with #Arsenal top man Johan Djourou to win pair of Carling Cup tickets: http://tinyurl.com/6xe9htp

#Arsenal press conference ahead of Carling Cup final vs #BCFC at lunchtime.
Fabregas wants to play. Understandable. Captain wants to lead #Arsenal at Wembley. Wenger cautious no with Barca in mind for Cesc and Theo
#Arsenal boss Wenger rules Cesc out of final. Wenger said: 'he's sad and disappointed.'
"#Arsenal boss Wenger says RvP wiil skipper team. Walcott out for '2 to 3 weeks.' Wenger adds: 'Good feeling in camp, we're on a good run'"
Is 6 yrs without trophy a no go subject at #Arsenal? Wenger said: 'Good thing about this club is that you're allowed to talk about anything'
#Arsenal boss Wenger said: 'We need a big performance to beat highly motivated Birmingham team.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Walcott 'very unlikely' to be fit for Barcelona. Wenger added: 'But I would like to be pleasantly surprised.'

"#Arsenal legends all round today. Wenger in good form, great to catch up with Martin Keown and Sagna and @JohanDjourou both very friendly."
"Family today so go to MirrorFootball site or old thing called our 'newspaper' for #Arsenal preview inc Wenger, Cesc, Sagna wedding stories"
Talk in press room that #bcfc go 4-4-2 with Zigic and Martins. Martins famously destroyed #Arsenal a few years back while at Inter
"#Arsenal selection a little more straight forward, surely Bendtner. Football League very happy with Wembley pitch, looking good"
Teams arrived at Wembley. Cesc and Theo very much part of the #Arsenal set-up. Nice touch for the injured players
I think Rosicky over Bendtner is mistake - and not just because of my piece on NB52 in the Wembley programme. NB more physical for #Arsenal
People saying tracksuits shows lack of class.When #Arsenal lost at Wembley years back under GG they were accused of being arrogant in suits!
"Nasri wide right, Rosicky in central role, AA23 wide for #Arsenal. Wembley neutral stadium, neutral PA announcer, hired Old Trafford's!"
"Very even first ten minutes. #Arsenal had let off, Foster looked assured for #BCFC and #AFC went close through AA23 after finding rhythm"
"When you produce that sort of skill, maybe it entitles you to shoot, but Nasri bit greedy there. Wilshere playing well for #Arsenal."
"God reading of the game by Koscielny. #Arsenal not playing particularly well, #BCFC playing well - looking solid, hassling and harrying. 0-0"
"Terrific defending by Jiranek to stop RvP in his tracks. #BCFC playing well. #Arsenal need to get passing game going, Rosicky v quiet"
"#BCFC take lead - and that man Zigic again. 1-0. 28 gone. They've played really well. #Arsenal look nervy, that 6 year wait weighing heavy"
Djourou has just made two outstanding defensive blocks. #BCFC in the zone. #Arsenal clinging on a bit. Nasty challenge by Koscielny there
#Arsenal level. Wilshere hit bar then RvP led by example to make it 1-1. AA23 did brilliantly. #BCFC will b annoyed Bowyer off pitch at time
#Arsenal will be the happier team to go in at half time simply because #BCFC have played better and yet the score is 1-1. Good game.
"The drama keeps on coming. Fahey should score, but hits the post. #BCFC continue to play well. But #Arsenal looking better. Tense 1-1"
And that must be RvP struggling after his goal. Here comes Bendtner. He can provide new threat for #Arsenal
#Arsenal going for jugular with Chamakh getting stripped off. Wenger looking to exploit #BCFC at the back
"#BCFC look dead on their feet, all #Arsenal now. McLeish has so many injured players on that he doesn't know where to start..."
"#BCFC have fought so hard for this. Great spirit. The #Arsenal wait goes on. Terrific Carling Cup final. #BCFC go wild, #Arsenal broken"
#Arsenal shell shocked and now they will need all their mental strength to make sure the other trophies don't slip away in the hangover
Wenger claimed number of games took toll on #Arsenal. But insists they will bounce back. Big mental test now.
"#Arsenal Wilshere in tears at end. He looked really good first half but tiredness too its toll. That, and the mental blow, is big danger"
"For those looking to start a Twitter row, Wilshere crying not a negative. If #Arsenal had 11 with his spirit then they'd bounce right back"

@CFC_Clive No chance. If Arsenal player had done it I'd want him sacked. No place for guns mate or knives. Put club issues aside
@RickGlanvill Whatever Rick. If u feel guns are ok then good for u. Expected more. If it were an Arsenal player I'd want em sacked too
@ColinBoucher Arsenal v Sunderland then Bar-the-lona!
"@Shane_arsenal You're missing the point. If gaining bulk is performance enhancing, isn't losing weight if it makes u faster?"
Ramsey got great reception at #Arsenal when name read out. Kicked off early and #SAFC started brightly. #AFC nervy. 0-0
"#Arsenal started very nervously. Gonna be an awkward afternoon for Wenger. Bit better spell now, but #SAFC can make it tricky"
"And the ball goes up between Koscielny and Szczesny, the Emirates holds its breath... Thankfully for #Arsenal, this time Kos heads back. 0-0"
Bendtner overhead kick saved by Mignolet for #SAFC. Anywhere else in the goal and #Arsenal lead. Nasri giving everything - as usual. 0-0
Bendtner close again for #Arsenal. NB52 shot saved by #SAFC keeper Mignolet. 0-0. Arsenal not playing at their best but doing better
"Lots of exhaling and 'ooooh, tough game' going on in #Arsenal press room at h/t. Break improved by Depeche Mode's Just Can't Get Enough"
Djourou the pick of #Arsenal's defenders again today. #SAFC bang in this. Playing well. Chamakh warming up intensely. Henderson booked
Ramsey getting great reception whenever he comes out for a trot and warm up. #Arsenal need injection of attacking threat here. 0-0 nervy
"And to prove I'm a tactical genius (please note that was a joke), here comes Chamakh for #Arsenal..."
Welbeck on for #SAFC as Bruce goes for the jugular. Now they've got real pace and threat on the counter. #Arsenal can't over commit
Here comes Rosicky as #Arsenal look to reshuffle again. No thoughts of a rest for #Barcelona for any of the big guns though... F/kick here
Best chance yet and Chamakh hits the BAR for #Arsenal
Chamakh has made a big difference since coming on but should have scored rather than hit the bar from Wilshere's sublime cross #Arsenal
Wenger complains bitterly - and no wonder! TV replay shows even clearer that Bramble pushes AA23. Stone wall pen turned down for #Arsenal
TV replay shows Arshavin was ONSIDE. Think #Arsenal hard done by having that disallowed.
4 mins added time. Titles are won and lost on days like this. Pivotal weekend and #Arsenal need all three points. Hold onto your hats!
"All over at the Emirates. #Arsenal cursing, #SAFC played well and got their point. Muntari and Mignolet excellent for the visitors."
"#Arsenal deprived of a penalty and an offside decision, plenty to complain about. I despair when people don't read tweets properly"

Two great finishes by Bent for #AVFC 0-2. #Arsenal's end of season collapse going from bad to worse. Lap of appreciation may be interesting
End of season collapse become an embarrassment for #Arsenal. Got to question the professionalism of some of these players who have given up.
Finally a response from #Arsenal. Surely a pen after Dunne challenge on Ramsey. Wenger and Rice in technical area. Not happy.
"#Arsenal's last home game of season. Really poor so far. Lap of 'appreciation' will be a hard sell, let alone big season ticket price rises"
"#Arsenal fans at Clock End singing their hearts out. Major credit. Some players responding well, RvP in particular. #AVFC defending well 0-2"
"#Arsenal booed off at half time. Will the players ever get the message? Villa fans been loud, proud and enjoying superb first half. 0-2 Bent"
Here comes Chamakh for #Arsenal
Song moves into central defence. Arsenal go 4-4-2 with RvP and Chamakh up front. Desperate measure dor desperate times. 0-2
#Arsenal begun the 2nd half with no urgency. Have they forgotten they're losing 0-2? Villa looking very comfortable right now.
Arshavin off in the 62nd minute. I'm a huge fan of Arshavin's. Great talent. But he could have been subbed 61 mins ago. #Arsenal
"Attendance at #Arsenal decalred at 60,063. Aggregate for season: 1,848617. So that was just over a million for season."

Ah well. Villa fans can show their appreciation to #Arsenal's players for a gutless performance which gifted them three points.
The fans are chanting: 'Arsenal we love you.' It shouldn't be the fans clapping but the players. Embarrassing walk. The players owe fans.

"After #afc bright start, #scfc now having the best of it. Swansea's passing and movement causing Arsenal all sorts of problems. 1-1"
"Half time. Swansea playing super stuff, been tight game but they've edged it while Arsenal dangerous on counter. 1-1."
"Arsenal conceded three but Koscielny been superb, absolutely outstanding. Shows how bad the rest of the defence has been. 3-2"
Great win for Swansea. They've deserved this. 3-2. They out-Arsenal-ed Arsenal. 3-2. They're celebrating wildly - and so they should.

"Second Arsenal press conference, this time at San Siro. Journey brought flashbacks of terrifying lift in Malcolm MacDonald's car circa 1994."
"Wenger tightens up the #afc midfield (Song, Arteta, Ramsey, Rosicky) and has pace and options from the bench. Think Arsenal will score."
"It's the flanks that are worst. Purely coincidental of course that Arsenal's width and pace beat Milan last time... Wifi rubbish, too. #afc"

At #Arsenal press conference ahead of QPR game and at Loftus Road tomorrow. Love Loftus Road - great atmosphere. Tricky game for both...
#afc Wenger ready to go next round with Hughes. But even Wenger joked: maybe it's me... I'm off to QPR v Arsenal later http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Arsenal-Arsene-Wenger-ready-for-next-round-with-QPR-Mark-Hughes-article884855.html …
#afc Arsenal coach just turned up. Not exactly a warm welcome... But can hear Maria Petri cheering
"Arsenal started quite well. QPR in determined mood, game a bit niggly already. 0-0. QPR fans getting right behind their team."
"Arsenal fans barracking QPR keeper: ""Paddy Kenny: he eats what he wants."" Bit harsh. QPR having good spell. 0-0"
QPR bang up for this. Arsenal haven't been so far. You can't argue with 1-0 for QPR. They're looking lively. Arsenal not playing well. 1-0
"Ramsey, stuck on the left, been really poor for Arsenal. Ox and Gervinho on the bench. QPR been much the better team 1-0"
"RvP slipped ball through to Walcott. His first shot hit post but Walcott scored on the rebound. Arsenal not been playing well, but resilient"
Half time at Loftus Road. 1-1. QPR shaded it in my opinion. But Arsenal finished well. Taarabt first Prem goal. Walcott levels. ood game.
Brilliantly taken goal by Diakite to make it 2-1 QPR. Arsenal have not defended well and Vermaelen slipped up again. 68 gone
Vermaelen having a stinker. Hard to see a way back for Arsenal. QPR defending well and still causing Arsenal problems. 2-1 75 gone
"Arsenal 2-1 down, just over 8 left so send for the cavalry!!! They weren't available so on came Chamakh. QPR lifted straight away..."
That looked like a penalty to Arsenal. Onuoha picked it up and carried it to safety... Only kidding. But did look a pen. 2-1
All over. QPR win 2-1. They fought hard and got deserved win. Arsenal were poor.
"Arsenal players unhappy at end. Few moan at ref. Should look at themselves today. AOC goes to away fans, throws shirt to them - great touch"
"@JLQPR I thought QPR were terrific today, thoroughly deserved it. Arsenal were poor but they weren't nearly as fired up as QPR. Good luck."

Back on duty today for Arsenal v Man City. Should be a cracker. A must win for both but I fancy a draw. Sure Nasri will get a warm welcome..
Nasri's name greeted with very loud boo by #afc fans in stadium. Clichy given just a loud boo. Now playing Good Old Arsenal. Love tradition.
Yaya really struggling. Smashed his knee against Song's knee when fouled. He can barely run. Arsenal dominant but few roads through. 0-0
Dramatic goal line clearance from Vermaelen - shame it was to block RvP header giving Arsenal the lead. Pizarro coming on for Yaya. 0-0
Ox coming on for Arsenal
Arteta has been a revelation for #afc. Arsenal been much the better side today. Arsenal fans now doing the Poznan. No love lost!
"Arsenal win and City lose the title. The Arsenal delight goes beyond three points. Nasri, Clichy and the rest. Big questions now of Mancini."
Nasri left Arsenal in search of trophies. None at City either. Wonder if he'll ever question whether he's part of the problem. Doubt it.
"As for Arsenal, so impressive today. Arteta magnificent. Has really stepped up. Wenger can strengthen this summer and challenge next season."

"Three changes for Arsenal. Santos, Djourou and Ramsey in starting line-up. Wenger loves Ramsey away from home. Rosicky drops out."
"Arsenal haven't needed to get out of 1st gear after 11th minute. RvP, Walcott on target. Wolves fans booing everything & everybody @ h/t 0-2"

#afc Wenger hails 'remarkable achievement' of Arsenal's recovery in his prog notes. Chamakh is also interviewed. Always 'ready' apparently.
"Wigan 2-0 up. Incredible. Arsenal have, er, taken things bit lightly. Gomez."
Arsenal been a shambles and have a lot of coming back to do. And without the injured Arteta. Those Wigan fans might find journey worthwhile.
Chaos in the Arsenal defence. And they look flat everywhere else. Wigan's fluid tactics and formation leaving Arsenal puzzled and losing 1-2
Ox getting stripped and ready for action as #afc third sub. Chamakh thrown his gloves down in disgust. Arsenal fans breath sigh of relief.

Fabregas recalls celebrating Barcelona going through at Chelsea even though Arsenal had lost semi night before. 'Whole family Barca fans'
Fabregas has answered more questions in this CL press conference than he did in his final year at Arsenal. At least he got what he wanted.
Fabregas: 'I've learned a lot tactically. I know my position on pitch. At Arsenal I played wherever I wanted and was not good tactically'

"Arsenal playing worse today than I've seen at the Emirates all season. 1-1. If they mess it up, serious question marks over bottle."
Norwich ahead 1-2. Shocking by Arsenal. Norwich fans chanting: 'Thursday night Channel 5.' They may miss out on that at this rate. Holt
"No signs of an Arsenal recovery. In fact, Norwich still much the better team and far more likely to score the next goal. 1-2"
Arsenal have just got away with it - clear penalty. Koscielny has taken a chunk of Russell Martin's shirt home as a souvenir.
Arsenal booed off at half time. They've been shocking. Absolutely shocking. Not able to string 2 passes together. Norwich battered em 1-2
Arsenal out first for the 2nd half. They weren't first in any respect in the first half. Norwich 2-1 up and should have been more
Arsenal should be at least 4-1 down by now. RvP and Ramsey missed great chances. Here comes Ox. Huge cheer went up when Ramsey name went up
Jackson went clean through and passed back to Szczesny. Arsenal's crosses always hit first man. What does Ox have to do to get a game?!
That was coming. Arsenal still had no bottle even at 3-2 up. They've been shocking. Norwich deserved this. 3-3
That's it. 3-3. Wenger will moan about penalty never given. But Arsenal were poor in terms of performance and bottle. Bye bye 3rd place

Surely more goals to come at Hawthorns because Fulop is having awful game for West Brom and Arsenal so vulnerable at the back
All over. Arsenal win 2-3. Clinch third and Champs League.

Good news for #afc fans as Arsenal and Walcott discuss a new deal. I hope they go all out to keep a vital player: http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-theo-walcott-in-talks-on-new-1278371 …

Hope @MarkG_Arsenal has got us a brilliant #afc quote ready for after the Champions League draw...
"Arsenal Group looking very good, Even if it will spark an annual 'is it C or K' debate for one of the opponents Olympiacos (aka Olympiakos)."
"#cfc RDM was asked about Essien future earlier. There's been Fenerbahce, Arsenal interest. Sounded like RDM wouldn't want/allow Essien to go"
#afc Essien is NOT joining Arsenal. It's not something they've been pursuing today. #cfc
#cfc RdM confirmed before kick off that Essien could be going out on loan - but as I said earlier not to Arsenal
My understanding is that Arsenal were offered Essien - and not the other way round. They politely declined but was never on today's agenda

"Fabulous news for #afc Wilshere starts first game for Arsenal since May 2011. England, Arsenal, English football expects. No pressure then."
Really feel for Jenkinson. Drops down to the bench for Sagna. He's been superb for Arsenal. Could have played left back rather than Santos.
"But it's a bold move by Wenger to lift Arsenal mood. Walcott on the bench, too. Big day for #afc"
"Santos is Arsenal's new Eboue. Loveable fella, great character - but not up to it at this level. #afc"
Taarabt shoulder charge decks Wilshere. The Arsenal crowd wanted to lynch him. Wilshere won't mind that challenge. #afc

Mannone saves free kick. Arsenal fans biting their nails... 1-0
All over! Arsenal win 1-0

Arsenal's best corner of the season. Who took it? Walcott. Appreciated by his team mates. Give him the deal. Giroud - proper striker's goal.

I nearly tweeted earlier that Fulham's defending on Arsenal's goals was worst I've seen this season. Then Arsenal eclipsed them. 2-2
Fulham come within a whisker of making it 2-3. Chaos in Arsenal's defence. Arsenal fans boo the team off at half time. It is 2-2 h/time.
"Arteta mistake, pulls down Ruiz. Fulham penalty. Beautifully converted by Berbatov. Fulham lead 3-2. Arsenal a shambles."
Koscielny makes goal saving tackle on Berbatov. First decent tackle from an Arsenal player all game
Arsenal penalty
Fulham's equaliser should have been saved by Mannone. Arteta had his worst game in an Arsenal shirt. Berbatov a pure joy to watch.  #motd
"Giroud had his best game in an Arsenal shirt. Two goals, power and was a threat. If he'd taken the penalty... But never a penalty. Justice."
@arseblog @christoronyi Giroud had his best game in Arsenal shirt. Arsenal's whole problem is being short in all areas. That really is dumb.

Swansea started brightly and are dangerous going forward. They can commit more players as Arsenal have Gervinho playing up front. #forgetit
Arsenal have made a slow start which lacks tempo. The chant should be: 'Where has our pace and tempo gone?' Been missing recently. 0-0
Sensational Szczesny double save from Rangel stops Swansea going ahead. Arsenal fast asleep. Swansea bossing the game. 0-0
"Cazorla header - yes, really - brings a save out of Tremmel. Up until that point, Arsenal been playing like it's a pre-season friendly. Odd."
"Swansea outclassing Arsenal. They're passing the ball brilliantly, finding gaps and an Arsenal full of apathy. 0-0. #afc rarely this bad."
Arsenal's lack of physical presence is so obvious. Too many oompa loompas. Podolski and Gervinho's lack of desire an embarrassment. 0-0
Arsenal are playing as bad as they did at Norwich earlier this season. It's the worst I've seen them play at home for a long time. 0-0
"Moore on already for Swansea, Tiendalli about to come on. They've been terrific today, playing their part in making Arsenal look poor. 0-0"
Swansea score and deservedly so. Michu 1-0. Cue embarrassing mass exodus of Arsenal fans.
"Michu 0-2. Easy for Swansea, thoroughly deserved. Cue a fire drill among Arsenal fans. At least they won't get booed off - no-one left."
Arsenal will be grateful only 3 mins added time otherwise Swansea would score again. They've been brilliant.
All over. Those that are left boo loudly while Swansea's fans celebrate wildly. Arsenal truly awful today. 0-2
Arsenal won't get into the Champions League places playing like this. It's not a one-off. Far from it. They've been poor most of the season.
Swansea continue to dumbfound. They get a standing ovation from the visiting fans and the remaining Arsenal fans (the proper hardcore).
"As good as Swansea were, Arsenal so poor. Wenger has spent big dough in recent seasons. On some bang average players. Sign quality again."
Swansea boss Laudrup praises the 'fair play' of the Arsenal fans who applauded his team off. 'This is not more special than winning at QPR.'
Swansea boss Laudrup said: 'I don't think necessarily Arsenal are a worse team but they came up against a very good team today.'

You wouldn't believe this Arsenal team was the one which put 7 past Newcastle. They've not tested dodgy keeper Boruc and scored with an OG.

Ox now sacrificed to bring on Mertesacker to shore up defence with Arsenal at ten men. Ox gets great reception. 0-0
Arsenal fallen to pieces. Milner an absolute screamer for 1-0. Now Arsenal can't find another red shirt. A problem when you only have 10 men
Arsenal down to ten men. Diaby playing his first game in four months. But how can anyone argue that #afc squad doesn't need strengthening?
"City 2-0 up h/t. City have dominated ten man Arsenal. When the red mist descends, home fans will see it was a penalty and rugby tackle."
Giroud heads over Arsenal's best chance. The best thing you can say about Arsenal is they have shown resilience in the second half. 0-2
"Arsenal feel hard done by. But truth is unless they strengthen in January, can't see them finishing top 4. Gotta be some players out there"
Arteta out for three weeks. Huge blow. Arsenal need to strengthen. I pressed Wenger on this and the presser and he insists they are trying..

Chelsea 2 up. Arsenal can feel aggrieved on first but surely a red card for Szczesny on 2nd. Martin Atkinson levels it up.

"#afc Wenger says Beckham has asked to come to Arsenal to work on his fitness. 'He called me, purely for fitness no speculation on signing'"
David Beckham rides to the rescue again. Focus on his training stint at Arsenal dilutes headlines on lack of transfer activity. #superbecks
Meanwhile #afc boss Wenger says Arsenal have enough quality already to reach the top four. And talks up Gervinho... http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/transfers-arsenas-striker-hunt-is-not-1562031 …
Fair play to Arsenal for freezing ticket prices. And will announcing it now head off any backlash if #afc don't spend? http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-announce-ticket-price-freeze-1563041 …
More comedy defending from Arsenal. Suarez takes full advantage to put Liverpool ahead. 0-1 #lfc #afc
Arsenal are so bad defensively it's ridiculous. Suarez is destroying Arsenal. Szczesny is having the worst game I've ever seen him play.
Mancini has got his I Phone out. Maybe he's dialling 999 to get emergency help for Arsenal's help. Or seeing how much Suarez would cost.
Arsenal booed off h/t. TV cameras pan across to first Suarez and then Szczesny. The two central characters. Liverpool lead 1-0 and worth it.
Has Wenger started editing the Arsenal programme? They've printed League Table based on 1st half & 2nd half results. 12th at h/t 2nd at f/t
Liverpool will kick themselves for throwing away a two goal lead. But a point at Arsenal will surely be considered a good result.
"Liverpool strike force of Suarez & Sturridge looked dangerous. Arsenal will give thanks for Wilshere, Walcott and the ever improving Giroud"
@Agent_mb Waiting for long term targets in the summer. By which time Arsenal will not be in the Champs League
Why would Arsenal wait until summer to do all their transfer business? They'll be out of the top four by then. Surely Wenger can see that.
Love the fact the Arsenal programme has PL table after 1st half and 2nd half results. 12th at half time and 2nd after full time. #afc
Arsenal considering move for Valencienne left-back Gaetan Bong. Bong been offered to Arsenal after Gibbs ruled him out for three weeks.
"John Arne Riise available at Fulham. Why not take a punt Arsenal? Stephen Warnock been suggested, not happening."
I'm surprised Becks has opted for Paris over training with Arsenal. There's a New Look for Posh in the business park near London Colney.
Beckham had one day training with the Arsenal squad. Wenger realised he was gonna make Santos look bad so got his mates at PSG to sign him.
#afc squad short up front. I asked Wenger whether Henry's link with Usmanov had put Arsenal off resigning him this year. Wenger insisted not

Fair play to Arsenal and Wenger. Realised couldn't get through without good left back so spending £6m on Spanish international Monreal. #afc
#afc Arsenal been monitoring Monreal for a while. Not a panic buy. Only on the final day because circumstances changed and forced their hand
I think that's it now for Arsenal's business. A good deal for Monreal. Quality international from world champions. A good day for #afc

@stevemyalleats @mirrorfootball Arsenal yet to unveil their secret weapon if things get really tough. Their deadly Italian Paulo Lasagne.
Walcott pace down the right vs Wilkinson is the most noticeable thing so far at Arsenal. Game still awaiting first big chance. 0-0
Finally a chance and some goal mouth action. Wilshere corner fell to Ox and smart block by Begovic. Quality keeper. Arsenal 0 Stoke 0
Arsenal 0 Stoke 0 h/t. Begovic the star of the show.
Arsenal need to pretend they are a goal down because there is no urgency about their play whatsoever and rarely is until they go behind. 0-0
"Stoke defended brilliantly. But Arsenal have also lacked ideas, invention and creativity. Very dull game. 0-0"
Referee over rules linesman and goal stands. 1-0 Arsenal
All over. Arsenal win 1-0. Podolski deflected free kick wins it. Sums it up. #afc not at their best. Stoke's only effort on target was OG.

Back in the saddle with a double header this weekend. Arsenal v Blackburn today followed by Chelsea v Brentford tomorrow. I love the FA Cup.
Cheeky grin from Bentley at the Arsenal fans giving him stick as he sits back down. Bet he gets on...
Arsenal fans seem very pleased to see him.
"Cazorla, too. Walcott and Wilshere also coming on. Arsene Wenger has blown his little trumpet and here come the Arsenal cavalry. #afc"
Cup shock on the cards klaxon. Arsenal fan Kazim-Richards scores 0-1. Blackburn only got 13 mins to hold out.
"Blackburn defended well first half, got better second half and punished Arsenal's lack of intensity. #afc been poor"
"Blackburn through, Arsenal out. Barring Champs League miracle, that's 8 years without trophy. Lack of respect for silverware"
Wenger needed that trophy. Arsenal need a trophy. Fourth not enough anymore. Shouldn't be mutually exclusive. Need silverware.
Arsenal paid heavy price for not being focused on the job in hand. Each game as it comes cliche not observed today. Blackburn heroic.
Arsenal gone eight years - going on nine - without a trophy. Last trophy? FA Cup. It doesn't take a rocket scientist...
Find it bizarre so many PL clubs rest players for trophy their fans want to win. Norwich did it last round. Arsenal did it. Will Wigan? #odd

"And if Arsenal upset Bayern, the critics can say how silly the fans are. But no trophy since 2005 is too long. Far too long."

"Bayern Munich fans singing ""Football's coming home."" Arsenal haven't started yet. 0-2"
Bayern inches away from a third. It wouldn't have flattered them. They've been on a different level to Arsenal. #afc utterly outclassed 0-2.
Arsenal fans now chant: 'Come on Arsenal.' It's a long way back. 0-2

I'm off to Arsenal v Aston Villa. Dusting down my book of cliches to declare: it's a must win for both clubs. #afc #avfc
"There's water everywhere near 'The Bear' roundabout! Burst pipe. If you're going to Arsenal v Villa, leave early"
"Having left my Twitter feed open twice in Arsenal press room, I'm going to be more careful. Mind you, my score predictions are often wrong!"
Arsenal nervous despite the goal. Villa applying some pressure. Have keepers given up on catching the ball?
"Arsenal's passing is quite poor. They're giving possession away and adding to their own nerves. Villa doing OK, Weimann playing v well. 1-0"
"Arsenal lead 1-0 at half time. Villa been in this game. Even Wilshere's not having a great game today. Not a good game, scrappy."
Arsenal very low key first half. Often seems they can't get going or motivate themselves until the opposition score. Leaders needed.
Clark missed a great chance for Villa. Weimann monstered Monreal first half. Arsenal must find solution or Villa will get summat. 1-0
"Giroud done OK, but he's got to attack the space, take a chance once in a while. Far too often, Arsenal have no-one in the danger zone"
"1-1 Villa, they ran through the Arsenal midfield and defence as if they weren't there. Weimann ran from half way line."
N'Zogbia replaced by Hawkins. Can a Spurs man bury Arsenal now?
In Arsenal mixed zone. Hoping to speak to Cazorla. May have to rely on my Spanish picked up from Dora The Explorer.
Cazorla outstanding for Arsenal. Not just the 2 goals - great work rate. Wilshere looked tired but still tried. Jenkinson did very well #afc
"At a guess, there were 50,000 in the Emirates. Tickets sold made it sell-out. Arsenal need to revive their fortunes to get crowds back #afc"
@PoznanInMyPants @blackburngeorge I've watched it again. You guys talk as if every Arsenal player is No1. They're fifth for a reason. Night.

Arsenal well below par. Thought they'd slip up in one of these next three games. Norwich defending really well. 0-0
The fact is Arsenal have played poorly and it's up to the opposition to break a team down. No-one can have any complaints.
Ox coming on. Arsenal complaining about the referee. He can't possibly be playing as badly as them. No urgency. 0-1

I'm at Arsenal v Everton tonight. A must win for both sides' Champions League ambitions. Far too tight to call but Everton in great form.
"@BoxingKangaroo Good theory, somewhat incorrect. I've tweeted links to several Arsenal stories so wanted to provide balance. Only 140chars.."
"@ChapmansTribute Get a grip, mate. My previous links were about Arsenal. So one tweet about Everton form shouldn't be seen as hell on earth."
Arsenal v Everton team sheet pic.twitter.com/zUxjHyZWqz
Everton made the better start. Arsenal only shown glimpses. Moyes' men putting the strong arm on midfield and looking more dangerous. 0-0
Baines free kick.. Arsenal fans hold breath... Charged down
"Thought Everton were terrific, particularly first half. Midfield fought and scrapped, but the bite on Arsenal. Barkley looks great prospect."
"Arsenal improved second half. But how Wenger must wish he had a top, top quality finisher. Giroud so often goes for power over precision."
Made Jagielka Man of the Match. Nearly went for Barkley. Could have chosen Distin. Thought Ramsey was tireless for Arsenal. Gibbs good too.
"@Alan_Alger_ @Josh_Landy If Arsenal had a finisher they'd have won the game. Mind you, Everton would probably feel the same."
My match report on Arsenal 0 Everton 0. Tottenham and Chelsea the big winners after stalemate. Made Jagielka my MotM http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-0-0-everton-match-report-1304787 …
"For the record, thought Everton were excellent. Arsenal could do with a bit more of their muscle and toughness in my humble opinion."
Arsenal grew stronger as the game wore on. They became the better team second half. If only they had a centre forward who could finish...
"@paullesurf Yes, but Arsenal fans get upset when Everton and Norwich put up a struggle."
Here's my #afc web column and THREE good reasons why I think Arsenal will spend big this summer: http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/hey-big-spender-three-reasons-1839005 …
At Arsenal ahead of Wenger's pre-match press conference for Fulham. Wonder what was the first record Arsene bought?
"@ncustisTheSun @neilashton_ I'm proposing to Jack Wilshere in a tweet we're printing in the paper tomorrow. That's your Arsenal news, pal."
#afc Wenger says Mertesacker is the glue which holds the Arsenal defence together: http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fulham-vs-arsenal-per-mertesacker-1841797 …
Good to see #afc Arsenal listening to fans on ticket prices and introducing Young Guns enclosure. Junior Gunners make a comeback.
I'm off to Fulham v Arsenal. Beautiful sunshine. Got my sunglasses packed. Fulham fired up after midweek defeat. #ffc #afc
Giroud hits the post. No doubt there's a stat for that. Closest Arsenal have come. 0-0
"Arsenal 1 up. Walcott f/kick, Koscielny headed on and Mertesacker heads in"
And we're off. Wenger comes out late for 2nd half and has to jog all suited and booted past the Arsenal fans.
Arsenal have started really poorly in this 2nd half. Game far from over. Fulham still dangerous. 0-1
"Wilshere and Podolski on for Walcott and Rosicky, 71. If they don't keep the ball better then Arsenal will blow it. 0-1"
"Arsenal so flat and jaded. They've been sloppy, not played well"
Petric on for Fulham as Jol goes for what would be a deserved equaliser. Some poor Arsenal performances. Monreal given ball away so much
"All over. Arsenal got away with that big time. Mertesacker the hero. Sidwell, Giroud the villains. Koscielny MotM. 0-1"

"Arsenal to appeal Giroud red. No, they're not hoping for game to be added for frivolous appeal..."
@deanowasthere89 Arsenal relied on him too heavily and won nothing so the squad was flawed. Man U won title with him so theirs isn't.

"Mind u, it is bizarre that Arsenal don't have natural back up for their suspended c/forward. And that is down to Wenger. Money was available"
Don't let us down @wengerknowsbest I can feel an amusing 'Arsenal better than Barcelona' tweet coming on.
"To suggest RvP would get anything but booed is pie in the sky. But don't sing THAT song. After all, Arsenal fans don't like a Wenger song."
But the rivalry dynamic has always been Arsenal/Tottenham. That's the one and always will be for many fans.
"Here's a column from year ago. You can leave Robin, but ask Arsenal fans for permission... And Brady & Stapleton etc http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/the-arsenal-column-why-robin-van-persie-837080 …"
"@SouthernGoliath Absolutely, but Arsenal fans seem to have. Want it both ways."
@vinnysmith67 @SSNSpursEmma Agreed. But Arsenal fans seem to have
@thegmanN17 I agree with you. Campbell far worse. And yet Arsenal fans think that deal was ok but RvP out of order. Double standards.
"RT: @JamieDalton82: Bild on Rene Adler/Arsenal http://bit.ly/15KC1tu  >> Thanks, Jamie. Good to see them following up English press"
Off to Arsenal v Manchester United later to observe the guard of honour. And a football match may break out later. #afc #mufc
"But hope Arsenal fans don't cross the line on RvP. We expect boos, stick and jeers. But cheers from Man United fans. What a player."
Be good to see Podolski start up front for Arsenal. That would be a big opportunity for a highly talented player to show his true class #afc
Here come Arsenal who line up either side of tunnel to give #mufc guard of honour
"RvP last out. Loud cheers from Man U fans, boos from Arsenal. I saw about two Arsenal fans turn their back. That was a non event. #afc #mufc"
Lovely RvP cross for Jones and he headed wide. Should have been 1-1. A gift of a chance. Arsenal 1 Man United 0
"RvP booked for late challenge on Mertesacker. Mert was glowing about RvP before the game, said Arsenal players voted for him as PotY."
Terrific save from Szczesny to deny RvP at point blank range. Rosicky and Ramsey played very well for Arsenal. 1-0
"Wilshere coming on for Rosicky. Blimey, thought Rosicky had been Arsenal's best player."
All over 1-1. Arsenal not quite good enough. Awful by Sagna. Ruthless brilliance by RvP. Arsenal played well but United had more chances.
"Not for the first time, an Arsenal v Man United game ends in lots of talk about the post match grub. #pizzagate"
@AlexStone7 Perfect for Arsenal!
Champs Lge place no longer in Arsenal's hands. If Spurs win all their games (inc Chelsea) and Chelsea win the other 3 then Arsenal miss out

"Industry figures blown away by figures involved. On top of Emirates sponsorship, Arsenal have struck a fantastic deal. Major praise required"
"On a huge day of football stories, Arsenal's Puma deal is No1 most read on @mirrorfootball site. Thanks very much. Good to feel appreciated."
@jonawils I imagine you don't like the half time cakes at Arsenal. Bet they go all squidgy in your pockets...
"@honigstein Mind you, you did tell me Podolski wasn't joining Arsenal"
@honigstein We had a conversation in the Arsenal press room and you said no chance. It was before the German media had picked up on it.
"@honigstein We can't know it all, Rafa. No shame in that. One of your tweets suggested Arsenal watching Reus not Podolski."
Second most read story on the entire @DailyMirror site is Arsenal's kit deal with Puma. No1 story was Amanda Berry. Thanks for reading.

"Benayoun shouldn't have kissed the Arsenal badge while on loan. But if the abuse runs deeper, then shame on you... Don't boo your own either"
@GeoffArsenal I don't think Arsenal will win both their remaining games. Then it could be up to others. Chelsea looked shattered tonight.
"@GeoffArsenal Chelsea looked dead in last 20. A big worry. Just think Spurs will do it. Arsenal's results good, but not been playing great."
@MERCY_ARSENAL @kevsat1 Thanks. My predictions often wrong anyway! Think people confuse what I predict with what they think I want to happen

@MattHughesTimes Maybe. But Real Madrid not come in yet and will they pay £40m? Not sure. At least Arsenal showing they mean business.

"One good thing for me to look forward to... On @talkSPORTKO shortly to discuss Arsenal's tour, Suarez and more. Join me from Tokyo"
Will Suarez happen? My view is it all comes down to that clause and if the player acts up. Players have acted up with Arsenal and been sold.
And maybe Liverpool will see how much stick Arsenal got over RvP (a similarly impossible position) and decide it's not worth it. Fair play.
"Interesting #afc debates tonight. But are people really suggesting Arsenal have bid for Suarez without Wenger approval? Come on, be serious."
"Arsenal won't budge on £40,000,001 for Suarez (at least not yet) as it's all about the clause. Could go to the wire http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenals-luis-suarez-transfer-bid-2102816 …"

In every piece I've written I've said Liverpool are adamant the clause won't work. It's still going to be hard for Arsenal to get Suarez.
But a bit naive to suggest Arsenal didn't add on the £1 without encouragement and for a reason.
"Bernard's agent played a blinder. Linked the player with Arsenal who were never interested, according to Wenger, and now draws out Shakhtar."

2-1 Porto. Napoli's Fernandez own goal. It's all up for grabs as we stand. This result suits Arsenal ahead of another Emirates Cup assault..

It seems Arsene Wenger is leading a one man crusade against rising transfer prices. Arsenal are being caught in a timewarp by his philosophy
"Arsenal to go back in for Cabaye, lots of targets, Ox out till Xmas, injury update ahead of Fenerbahce #afc #nufchttp://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-yohan-cabaye-2188857 …"

At Fenerbahce stadium. Wedding taking place. Groom furious. Says Arsenal disrespectful for holding press conference on day of ceremony
Seems like I've been in the Fenerbahce press room for three days and still an hour until the Arsenal press conference starts. Amuse me pls
"Fair play to Wenger. He took all the questions we fired at him. Spurs are spending, why aren't Arsenal? Cabaye? And is it poor preparation?"
"Good answers with a feel of: trust me, we'll get it right, we'll get through and seemed incredulous at the thought of Spurs catching Arsenal"
We'll see. His answer that 75pc of deals are done in the last fortnight is no excuse and as convincing as Arsenal's preparations thus far.
#afc Wenger facing make-or-break for Arsenal's season. And we've only had one game. http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/john-cross-arsenal-prickly-wenger-2193979 …
#afc Wenger calls for Arsenal fans to trust in him over his transfer record and CL qualification record http://mirr.im/168ugYX 
Arsenal's 'escalation of financial firepower' should surely see them going for tried and trusted keepers rather than take a punt again.
Saving grace could be Fenerbahce could yet get CL K/O. UEFA showing a touch of Arsenal's transfer dealings about their disciplinary process.
"But without question, every single club that Arsenal wants to do business with has either snubbed them and or demanded unrealistic fees."
Hot here in Istanbul. Is going to get a lot hotter for Arsenal later. But remember 6th play-off in 8 years. It's 100 per cent record so far.
Arsenal starting XI strong. Should - and I stress should - be enough to go through. It's the depth of the squad and bench which worries.
400 Arsenal fans have made the trip to Turkey via all manner of places. Sensational support. But they'll do well to be heard tonight.
If only Arsenal had a striker to give them a cutting edge... 0-0
Arsenal no luck with injuries at all at the moment. Koscielny off with cut head after Webo kicked him in the face. Jenkinson on. Sagna c/b
"Well, that's why Arsenal need a striker. Arsenal have dominated but no end product. Ramsey, Rosicky and Wilshere played well. 0-0 h/t"
The other thing which strikes me is how bad Fenerbahce are. If Arsenal can't beat them...

Can Arsenal pull off a sensational deal for a Real Madrid star? Watch my @MirrorFootball video here:http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/karim-benzema-arsenal-john-cross-2228519 …
Arsenal team as expected. Wilshere and Monreal the changes. Should be easy street. Fenerbahce poor. #afc remarkable record in Champs League.
1-0 Ramsey. If there's one Arsenal player who deserves a goal as a reward for recent displays it's Ramsey. Magnificent.
"Arsenal's new striker steps forward, ready to come on... Yes, it's free transfer Yaya Sanogo."
"Arsenal, having used all three subs, now have Wilshere down injured. How long does the injury list have to be before Wenger spends?"
Here's my 1st report for @mirrorfootball on Arsenal 2 Fenerbahce 0. Wenger on Mata & rewrite with quotes coming soon http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-2-0-fenerbahce-ramsey-double-2231419 …
"Wenger far more coy when asked whether Mata's father, who is also his agent, was a guest of Arsenal in directors' box. Very intriguing..."
I can picture Arsenal hierarchy plying Mata snr with wine & canapes.. Don't forget many at Arsenal thought Mata deal was done 2 years ago...
"Here's my rewrite on Arsenal 2 Fenerbahce 0. Wenger on injuries, transfers and qualification not enough #afc http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-2-0-fenerbahce-ramsey-double-2231419 …"
"And here's Wenger on Mata. Was his father a guest of Arsenal? Wenger: ""No. I don't know. Maybe."" Naive to dismiss it. http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-chelseas-juan-mata-2231691 …"

Theo Walcott says: Bring on Tottenham. We fancy our chances against anyone. The Arsenal winger in the mood for Sunday http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/north-london-derby-arsenals-walcott-2234189 …
"Group of Death for Arsenal. Dortmund, Marseille and Napoli. Still, at least Wenger has all those new signings... #Higuain"
"@philmcnulty Yes, chuck in free agents Sol Campbell, Jens Lehmann, Robert Pires and Francis Jeffers and Arsenal can go all the way."
Do I think Bendtner will play for Arsenal's first team again? Doubt it. Wenger being nice. What else would he say?
"Shall we all play that embarrassing North London derby game about how few Arsenal players would get in a combined Spurs, Arsenal XI?"
Then wait for the end of the season and watch Arsenal prove everyone wrong by finishing above Spurs to show they've got a stronger squad.
I've made a fool of myself in the past thinking Spurs would finish above Arsenal. If Arsenal don't buy then surely Spurs will finally do it.
"Wenger is refusing to panic. He'll leave that to the Arsenal fans. If Spurs win on Sunday, then surely even Wenger must realise fans unhappy"
@talkSPORTDrive Ha ha. I'm sure it's Arsenal related! It made me laugh as a toilet plunger is about the level of my DIY expertise.
"Pressure is on Wenger to spend, spend, spend. Can they pull off deal for Draxler? Lots of Arsenal targets in the mix http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-arsenal-move-2239578 …"
"@ConorHadley Arsenal bid for him. I reported it. Funnily enough, I think that's a story. Why people put rumours round now is bizarre. Night."
RT @MirrorFootball: Arsenal have a stronger squad than Spurs insists Arsene Wenger http://mirr.im/1dzkk4E  >> Really? Views?
"Is Wenger right? Are Arsenal still stronger than Spurs? For all the Spurs love-in, lots of untried players in the PL. But Arsenal no depth."
What strikes me is that Arsenal's bench so weak. No scope to change a game. That could be vital. Few will be surprised to see me tip Spurs.
Arsenal have a really good starting XI. But a great weakness is not being able to change a game because of a poor bench and weak squad.
"Obituary in Arsenal Remembers in programme. Derek Gendler, a fan for 70 years. Was lucky to have known him for 25. Condolences. Proper gent."

"Ozil had been reluctant to come to Arsenal. They've persuaded him. It's all on. Imagine Ozil central, Cazorla left. Wow. #afc"
"Ozil agreed, Viviano agreed. Arsenal still in the market for more... #afc"
We broke the news of Arsenal in for Ozil on August 21. Been so many targets this summer. But this guy is world class. Signing of the summer.
Arsenal still in for a striker. Demba Ba and Abel Hernandez were two names yesterday. Ba's fitness and if Chelsea will sell is the key. #afc
"But Demba Ba very much on Arsenal's agenda now on a season long loan. Great coverm back-up, competition. Wenger wanted him in January. #afc"
"As we told u this morning, Arsenal in for Ba. Talks ongoing. Will #cfc loan to a rival? #afc want to do deal despite obvious medical issues."
"Lots of tweets saying Chelsea loaned Benayoun to Arsenal. Sadly, I think that was designed to weaken a rival rather than strengthen..."
Arsenal not the only club in for Ba. he's had offers from Germany and former club West Ham this summer. Interesting dilemma for Ba and #cfc
German media now reporting what we told you much earlier - Mesut Ozil on his way to Arsenal. #donedeal
Arsenal to announce Mesut Ozil shortly. They're still working on Demba Ba. Hoping to agree deal. Time for one more...? #afc
Here's my @MirrorFootball video with the latest on Arsenal's incredible deal for Mesut Ozil #afc http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-latest-news-mesut-2246074 …
Arsenal have done the second biggest deal in English football history. I think that answers the ambition question. Ozil genuine world class.
"They've also signed Viviano, an Italian international keeper. And they're still trying on Ba. What a 24 hours for Arsenal. #afc"
Struggle to believe Bendtner to Palace is dependent on Arsenal signing a striker. Bendtner is a million miles from Arsenal's first team.
"@GaryLineker Completely agree that Arsenal need a striker to cover for Giroud. Sadly, that's no longer in Bendtner's job description."
"Sadly for Arsenal, Ba not happening. Chelsea don't want him to join a rival. After signing Ozil, Arsenal are a title tival IMO. #afc #cfc"
That's it now for Arsenal. Don't expect anything else. Viviano and Ozil represents a big day for #afc. Ozil among top 10 players in world
"Mesut Ozil CONFIRMED. He's issued a statement. ""I'm looking forward to my future in the Premier League and at Arsenal."""
What a signing. Mesut Ozil joins Arsenal. £42m. Arsene Wenger goes from transfer window ditherer to genius in the space of 24 hours. #afc
Mesut Ozil turned down bigger offer from PSG to join Arsenal. Why? Because of the Wenger factor. Keep the faith #afc http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-mesut-ozil-turned-2246564 …

Sent my first entry for @MirrorFootball live blog. An injury blow for Liverpool. Nothing from the bench for Arsenal http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-vs-liverpool-live-goal-2668773 …
Crisis over. Arsenal go five points clear. Two cracking goals by Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey. Some people have lost their heads this week
"For every Mike Dean there's a Martin Atkinson, Arsenal fans."
Thought Liverpool would get a result today. Arsenal thoroughly deserved it. Arsenal's quality in midfield was the overwhelming factor.
"There has to be a big difference between ""can"" Arsenal win the title and ""will"" they win it. Of course Arsenal can win it. Playing so well."
"The atmosphere at the Emirates was really good - and loud. Terrific game, intense contest and surely shows Arsenal are in title hunt."

Will be interesting to see how Arsenal fill the bench for the first team and put out a team vs Dortmund in the Champs League youth game #afc
About to head over to Dortmund's stadium for pre-match press conferences. Huge game for Arsenal. Westfalenstdion must inspire not intimidate
Arsenal look strong. Only thing is missing is Walcott pace on the break. Dortmund without Hummels makes them slightly weaker. Predictions?
If Arsenal get a draw here in Dortmund then they will have done well. Defeat and you're relying on other results for the rest of the Group.
One final thought - Arsenal away support is always sensational. They are singing their hearts out and making great noise.

15 min delay to kick off at Arsenal
"Arsenal 1-0 Giroud. Assist by Boruc, shocking mistake as he got caught in possession"
Arsenal lead and had some lovely chances but Southampton been better team IMO. Jay Rodriguez been outstanding. 1-0
Penalty to Arsenal
Arsenal not been at their best while Southampton have given them a big test. But credit to Arsenal who have dug in to earn the points.
I thought Southampton played well but not enough cutting edge today. Arsenal ground out the victory and deserved it with their resilience.
@alanwayne1975 I thought Arsenal deserved the win overall. But even Wenger gave Southampton a lot of credit
Arsenal deserved the win today. Find it odd why some can't give Southampton credit. They played their part and Arsenal had to be good to win

Monreal and Rosicky in for Arsenal. Gibbs is ill. Rosicky replaces Cazorla. #afc

"Come on, Arsenal. That midfield of Flamini, Ramsey, Wilshere, Rosicky and Ozil looks awesome. Big night. Big performances required."
Arsenal in control - but need another goal to be sure. Wilshere been outstanding. Ozil needs a goal after that penalty. 1-0 h/t #afc

This is not just about sleeves. It's about tradition. The fact Arsenal has a boss and players who respect that is something to be proud of.

Odemwingie coming on for Cardiff. Cardiff really giving Arsenal a torrid time. 0-1
Arsenal back in control again after Cardiff's excellent start to the second half. Still need a second goal as Cardiff never give up. 0-1
"Arsenal lead 2-0. Ozil has set up both goals. And done little else. But then again, you probably don't need to. Great finish Flamini."
Arsenal 3-0. Ramsey again. And no celebration. Arsenal have thoroughly deserved this. But for 10 mins after h/t they have totally dominated.
Arsenal 7 points clear. People might have to start taking them seriously soon.
"All over. Huge win for Arsenal. Puts pressure on the rest. Ramsey 2, Flamini. Great finishes."
Cardiff - what terrific fans. Mertesacker last to leave as he milks the magnificent Arsenal fans chanting BFG
Huge day so far for Arsenal. Surely Chelsea and Man City won't slip up? Otherwise people will have to find new reasons why #afc can't win it

"@mikeparry8 Got to be honest, more remember Neville Southall once defying Arsenal on his own. Best keeper I ever saw."
Arsenal win 2-0. Cazorla and Rosicky. Thought Gnabry and Rosicky excellent. Spurs were catching Arsenal - but they're now going backwards.
Spurs were gaining fast on Arsenal. Today felt like they'd rewound 5/6 years. Back to old dominance. One-off due to injuries or big shift?
"i thought Rosicky was sensational, one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt. What a season he's having."
@deanowasthere89 @HeartOfTheHolte I got dog's abuse from Arsenal fans for suggesting Spurs had been closing the gap (before this season).

Big Arsenal online community... When we broke Puma kit deal in May it got more hits than Fergie retiring on same day http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-agree-puma-kit-deal-1874661 …
"Arsenal CEO Gazidis speaks passionately about this deal being a ""vindication"" of the club's path. Exciting times for #afc"
Make no mistake. This is a huge deal for Arsenal. Their changing financial firepower means they can compete on every level. #puma #afc
"Every Arsenal fan, however, will be hoping that Puma go easy on the skin tight shirts..."
"Gazidis asked question if he'd welcome Arsenal wearing a onesie kit. Seriously. ""If Mertesacker and Arteta feel comfortable in a onesie..."""
My understanding is the Arsenal deal with Puma is worth £30m a year and is over 5 years. Worth £150m in total. Biggest in UK.
"Having lost Theo Walcott to injury (hugely important player to squad), I think Arsenal will regret it if they don't do a deal in January."
"At Chelsea for Mourinho press conference than down to Southampton v Arsenal. Seconds out, mind games round three"
"Down on South coast for Southampton v Arsenal. Awful weather. Rain and freezing temperatures. Saints missing a few, Arsenal need a win."
Traffic so bad it's even held up the Arsenal team bus (one to get the office worried).
"Don't worry, all ok... Huge game for Arsenal and chance to turn up heat on title rivals. Is there life for Southampton after Saint Nicola?"
"Arsenal been absolutely awful. Southampton excellent, fully deserve their half time lead. 1-0"

Szczesny bailed Arsenal out at the end with two top saves. But thought Lallana and Shaw were different class for Southampton.
Southampton deserved to win in my opinion. Thought they played v well. Arsenal awful first half. Slightly better 2nd half but Saints v good

"One man makes final decision on transfers at Arsenal and that's Arsene Wenger. Therefore, everything comes down to him. Stop blaming others."

I actually think Kallstrom could be good stop gap loan signing. I don't think there will be any more deals from Arsenal
"Salomon Kalou is killing Sebastian Frey as the player most ""linked"" to Arsenal down the years. Sadly, don't think it's a go-er."
Välkommen till Arsenal och lycka #kallstrom
I wrote about Arsenal being willing to pay the £37m to sign Julian Draxler in this morning's paper. Arsene Wenger didn't value him that high
And the same people who want Arsenal to sign a second rate or washed up striker are the same who complain that #afc signed Ju Young Park.
"I do feel, however, Arsenal are a striker light of a title winning squad. But now isn't the time to buy strikers. Last summer was."
But Arsenal enjoying their best season for years so can't quite see why today is being painted as such a crisis by some.
"@LBrooker11 There was no interest in Kalou. Kalou was interested in Arsenal, not the other way round."
Arsenal didn't make loan bids for Kalou or Vucinic. I think they made bids to join Arsenal. Neither were considered.
Arsenal loan Park to Watford - then re-sign him to solve their striker crisis

"Brilliant column by @OllieHolt22 on Arsenal. The fans, Wenger and volcanoes ready to blow. Great read: http://bit.ly/1nsFr8l "
Find it amazing how many Arsenal fans are in denial. Win and Wenger's a God. Lose and he must go. Few other supporters turn so quickly.
"Clearly, that is far from being every Arsenal fan. But it's a loud section of fans at games. And the Twittersphere can be even more ruthless"
I hope that the large section of Arsenal fans who appreciate what Wenger does for the club will make their voice heard the loudest.
At Arsenal vs Man United. Has Ozil spent the day in the gym drinking protein shakes? Big performance needed. Huge game for both sides.
"Fancy Man United to get a result. Arsenal nervy and weary. Moyes needs it, RVP fired up and looking to seize on #afc tension."

Easy to forget Arsenal one point off the top. But titles are all about momentum. In my opinion that was lost through a lack of Jan signings.

@lionsex they are arsenal fans so my description is accurate and nowhere do I say they speak for all.
Off to Arsenal v Liverpool later. Fancy Liverpool because of their momentum. Think #afc will make more changes than #lfc. We'll see...
I think Man City showed winning a cup tie can be momentum for Europe. Losing it much worse. Arsenal fans want a trophy - or so they tell me.
Arsenal resting players for a game they can win for a game they can't. Wenger playing with fire in my view. Huge gamble #afc
Liverpool have gone very strong. I think Wenger underestimating the strength of feeling among Arsenal fans and how much they want a trophy.
The Arsenal team looks a huge gamble to me. Sanogo up top. And the one that gets me is Ozil - doesn't he need a rest more than anyone?
Arsenal survived a whole minute without conceding this week. Impressive.

Where are the amazing Arsenal and Tottenham combined teams which can never happen? What is the ratio of players now? Oh how I miss them.
"@PaulPonting Thanks, Paul. At least you realised what Ozil and Out was about. I think City fans were more upset than Arsenal! I like yours"
"@sut87 OK. First edition, Arsenal claimed he was injured. It went in as claim he was injured. Afterwards, Wenger said he was injured."
@JsMills In as much as if Spurs win then they can make top 4. If Arsenal win then you'd think that's a top 4 finish if not better guaranteed
At Arsenal training ground for press conf. Surely #thfc have to win to stay in hunt for top 4 finish. #afc win probably nails down top 4

"Arsenal haven't won at WHL in PL since 2007. If they win today, they're right back in the title race with key rivals to play. Big chance."
If Arsenal can come through the next two games intact then just look at the run-in. That's a huge ask. But #afc bang in the race after this
"And having watched Liverpool earlier, they can win the title. No question. Especially with Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City playing each other."

Off to Emirates shortly. Arsenal v Swansea. Huge test of Arsenal's mental strength. Swansea consistently strong and tough opponents.
"#afc Only 2 changes for Arsenal, Vermaelen and Flamini both in. Pod and Kos out. Though Szczesny expected to play right wing, Ox in goal."
"Arsenal's intricate play continually breaking down. They look a team short on confidence, zip and ideas. Swansea comfortable and ahead 1-0."
"Arsenal booed off at half time. Swansea lead, brilliant Bony header."
Heartbreak for Arsenal and Flamini. Could have been even worse had ref Probert not blown for full time. 2-2
"No doubt about it, Arsenal got the jitters. Swansea will feel aggrieved."
How Arsenal needed a win. And probably deserved it overall. But no luck at the moment
"Flicking through my replies, never known such a split on whether Arsenal deserved something from the game or not"
Even Wenger admitted it's now a battle to hang onto fourth. Arsenal need a major confidence boost.
Where do Arsenal go from here? They look flat. Wenger down. Ramsey had setback. No idea when Wilshere back.

Feels like a pivotal day for Arsenal and Wenger's future. Wenger hasn't done very well against young progressive managers this season...
I'm off to Wembley later. Don't know whether Wigan can feast on the pressure and uncertainty surrounding Arsenal. Interesting day ahead...
The most damning thing is that Arsenal have no impact player on the bench.
Arsenal have been awful.
Arsenal getting that Birmingham feeling...
Arsenal will be desperate for it not to go to penalties. Yaya Sanogo might take one.
Oxlade-Chamberlain has run himself into the ground. Ox been Arsenal's best player for me. Gibbs has been excellent since coming on.
"@HarlowGooner @sharpy58  I think Arsenal deserved to win. Forgive me for being nice, but Wigan gave everything and to lose on pens is hard"
The FA Cup still matters and that viewing figure proves it. As does Wigan's dogged determination. And Arsenal's celebrations at the end.

#afc Wenger sounded out about Falcao. Here's our live @mirrorfootball Arsenal transfer blog http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-live-deadline-4142589 …
Worth remembering that Arsenal's need for a centre half is No1 priority. Chambers is only senior cover for Koscielny and Mertesacker.
"If #mufc complete deal for Falcao, that is one hell of a coup. Arsenal and Man City were definitely in for him, too. http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/transfer-deadline-day-live-arsenal-4142404 …"
On @btsport shortly as we build up to transfer deadline. Join us. It looks like Danny Welbeck to Arsenal could yet happen... #afc #mufc
I think Danny Welbeck is very good signing for Arsenal. Good to see they have responded and gone for it. That's proving their ambition. #afc
Worth remembering that Welbeck wouldn't have happened without #mufc signing Falcao. A late knock-on effect and bonus for Arsenal. #afc

@jeromepugmire Agreed - though I think he played really well in the WC final. But he needs some form for Arsenal.
@simply_arsenal  We do separate press conferences with him which aren't filmed but are in our newspapers and it's brought up most times.

Arsenal have thrown the kitchen sink at Jamie Vardy. Not a penny scrimped. I'm sure Arsenal's offer is better than Leicester's counter offer
"I don't think Arsenal have been ""played"" because they went for it unprompted, having knocked back a previous approach. We'll see..."
"But when I wrote on Sunday that Leicester had asked for more time to make better offer, feared Arsenal might miss out. Summat special at KP."

Hear Arsenal are in the mix for Lucas Perez. Everton had it all agreed. That's now on hold after Arsenal came in. More on @MirrorFootball
Arsenal very hopeful that £17m deal for Deportivo La Coruna striker Lucas Perez will be done. Maybe Champions League football swung it.
Arsenal very hopeful of getting this done. The game at Leicester suggested a striker needed more than a defender... https://twitter.com/mirrorfootball/status/768743253676097536 …
Many clubs try to structure deals in instalments. It really is pretty standard. Would still expect Lucas Perez to join Arsenal.
Great draw for Leicester. Spurs can get through and Arsenal really should.

Good on Arsenal to get deals done. But will never understand a logic - and it must be because it happens every year - in doing deals late.
"Good planning is getting deals done before poss blowing 9 points. In fairness, not just Arsenal. But clubs who buy early tend to do better"
"On Talksport @SportsBreakfast paper review at 7am. West Ham crash out, Pep's Barca reunion and Arsenal's late spending spree on back pages."

Easy option was for Wilshere to stay put. It's a great life at Arsenal. To go on loan is the brave choice. Deserves credit not criticism.
My impression is Arsenal happy to deal with Bournemouth. So was Italian route really an option? Not sure it was... So don't knock him.
