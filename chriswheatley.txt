"Arsenal XI v Fulham: Szczesny, Djourou, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Santos, Song, Arteta, Ramsey, Arshavin, Walcott, van Persie."
"Another strong subs bench for #AFC, includes experience in Koscielny, Diaby and Benayoun. All three in contention for Tuesday's CC game."
Half Time: Arsenal 0-0 Fulham - Martin Jol's side very organised in defence. Both teams with good chances. Walcott excellent in attack.
Full Time: Arsenal 1-1 Fulham - Vermaelen scores at both ends. AFC have now lost points the last ten matches that Mike Dean has officiated.
Vermaelen scores at both ends as Arsenal salvage draw: Arsenal 1-1 Fulham - http://tinyurl.com/6nebepj 
"Confirmed Arsenal XI: Fabianski, Djourou, Squillaci, Koscielny, Miquel, Frimpong, Coquelin, Benayoun, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Park, Chamakh."
CONFIRMED: Samir Nasri starts against Arsenal for the first time since his summer move from Man City. Hostile atmosphere expected for him.
Full Time: Arsenal 0-1 Man City - A strong City side scrape an undeserved win at the Emirates. Koscielny outstanding in defence.
"Djourou: ""I was talking to Kolo [Touré] the other night and even he was saying how much he loved Arsenal."""
"Arsenal XI v Wigan: Szczesny (GK), Koscielny, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Santos, Ramsey, Song, Arteta, Walcott, van Persie (c), Gervinho."
Former Arsenal defender Emmanuel Eboue has just scored for Galatasaray as well. Great stuff.
Terrible Wigan defending. Arteta was allowed so much time and space. He still had work to do but finished superbly. 1-0 to the Arsenal.
Half Time: #Wigan 0-2 #Arsenal - Comprehensive first half despite early attacking intent from Wigan. Arteta & Vermaelen with the goals.
"Treble substitution for Arsenal. Coquelin, Benayoun and Arshavin on for Song, Walcott and Gervinho."
"Full Time: Wigan 0-4 Arsenal - Easy in the end after supreme second half display. Arteta, Vermaelen, Gervinho and van Persie all scoring."

"Arsenal XI v Olympiacos: Fabianski (GK), Djourou, Squillaci, Vermaelen, Santos; Ox-Chamb, Coquelin, Frimpong, Benayoun, Arshavin; Chamakh."
Super finish from Rafik Djebbour. 10th consecutive home goal for him. Poor Arsenal defending. 0-1.
That might be Vito Mannone's last mistake in an Arsenal shirt. Absolutely shocking. 0-2.
Olympiacos dominating at the moment. Outplaying a sluggish Arsenal side. Big improvement needed.
Half Time: Olympiacos 2-0 Arsenal - AW will be livid with that first half performance. Defensively weak. Djebbour and Fuster with the goals.
Santos stretchered off with an injury just to rub salt into Arsenal's wounds even more. Miquel coming on.
Arsenal lucky once again. Pin-point passing from Oly. Should have wrapped it up by now. 5 mins to go plus stoppage time.

Kick-off at the Cottage. Vital game for #AFC. Let's start 2012 with a win.
Koscielny opens the scoring with a header. Deserved goal from the Frenchman. 1-0 to the Arsenal.
Dominant first half display from #AFC so far. #FFC still look a threat from set pieces and on the counter. Coquelin doing well.
Arsenal away support doing the team justice as always. Terrific noise coming from them. Ooh to be a Gooner!
Half Time: Fulham 0-1 Arsenal - Koscielny's header separates the two teams at the break. Chances at both ends but #AFC certainly edged it.
Unbelievable chance for Clint Dempsey at the far post. Arsenal fortunate to get away with some slack defending in last 10 minutes.
Squillaci heads it to Zamora. Fulham get the three points. Second half capitulation from #AFC. Wasted chances come back to haunt them again.

"Everton may be without Seamus Coleman, Darron Gibson and Jack Rodwell for tonight's Premier League match against #AFC."
#AFC showed superb resilience against #EFC. More of the same needed in next nine games and third place is ours. Proud to be a Gooner.
Arsenal are favourites to finish third - http://tinyurl.com/7g4ax8t 
#AFC v #AVFC: Johan Djourou comes in for Koscielny who was injured in the pre-match warm up. Gervinho starts.
Great stuff from #AFC. Songinho with the assist for in-form Walcott. 2-0.
"Full Time: #AFC 3-0 #AVFC - Comprehensive win for Arsenal who gain further ground on Spurs. Gibbs, Walcott and Arteta with the goals."
"Arsenal, Chelsea, Olympiacos, AC Milan, PSG, CSKA Moscow & Athletic Bilbao expected to take part in the 2013 Next Gen tournament. Exciting."
Arsenal have been awarded more penalties than any other Premier League club in 3 of the last 8 seasons.
"Emmanuel Petit on Arsene Wenger: ""He is like the stone of Arsenal, if you kick him out you don't know where they will go."""
Cologne's chairman has reportedly informed the club's board that Lukas Podolski will join #AFC at end of the season.
Laurent Koscielny is back in the squad for tomorrow's game at QPR. Defensive boost for #AFC.
Arsenal's eight in a row would see them match the Invincibles - http://tinyurl.com/cekhroo 
"#AFC XI v #QPR: Szczesny (GK), Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Song, Arteta, Rosicky, Ramsey, Walcott, van Persie (c)."
Disjointed performance from #AFC. Vermaelen culpable for both #QPR goals. Spurs can get level on points if they win tomorrow. Disappointing.

Laurent Koscielny will miss #AFC's next two games after his booking. Means he'll be fresh for game against Chelsea.
Samir Nasri is substituted by Mancini. 'What a waste of money' rings out from the #AFC fans. Anonymous.

"Arsenal want £1million for goalkeeper Vito Mannone who is on loan at Hull, according to the Daily Mail."
Arsenal v Chelsea Preview - http://tinyurl.com/76z7bw9 
Half Time: Arsenal 0-0 Chelsea - #AFC's best chances came towards end of first half. Koscielny unlucky with header. Scrappy game so far.
Full Time: Arsenal 0-0 Chelsea - Drab game in which both sides cancelled each other out. #AFC had better chances & could have won.
Tottenham back where they belong - outside the top four. It seems like a long time ago they were 13 points above #AFC! #NorthLondonIsRed

GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 Norwich - Great play from Kieran Gibbs for Yossi Benayoun's 2nd minute goal. #AFC have started superbly. 1-0.
No real surprise at the Emirates. Norwich have dominated the game since Arsenal's goal. Hoolahan smashes it past Szczesny. 1-1.
"Grant Holt scores a deflected effort over Szczesny, similar to Louis Saha's in the 5-2 match with Spurs. #AFC being embarrased here. 1-2."
"Champions League football is in the balance for #AFC. The players look like qualification has already been secured. Sort it out, Arsenal."
Half Time: Arsenal 1-2 Norwich - CL qualification on the line. #AFC lucky not to have goalscorer Benayoun sent off & concede 2 pens. Poor.
There are over 19 million results on Google for the search term 'arsenal poor defending'. Enough said.
#AFC finally starting to show some attacking intent with quickfire RvP and Vermaelen chances. Less than 25 minutes to go.
Robin van Persie equalises for #AFC. Where would be without the Dutchman? Probably 7th or 8th in the League. Now for the winner.
The BEST striker in WORLD football makes it 3-2. He scores when he wants. He wins games when he wants. Outstanding #AFC comeback.
Morrison deflates the #AFC players with a late strike. Another error from Thomas Vermaelen. Less than 5 minutes to go. 3-3.
#AFC now relying on Aston Villa & Manchester City for massive favours tomorrow. Have a feeling third place will be decided on last day.

Great goal gays! @Andre_Santos27 equalises for #AFC. All square at the Hawthorns. What a game.
AW showing some passion on the touchline. Clenching his fists and punching the air. This game is massive. Come on Arsenal.
Half Time: #WBA 2-2 #AFC - As it stands third place belongs to #THFC. Some terrible first half defending from #AFC. Next 45 mins crucial.
Jenkinson easily turned by the average Fortune. Poor defending from him. #AFC missing @Sagnaofficial's presence at the back.
Laurent Koscielny pats the Arsenal badge. He's a Gooner. He's made it 3-2. Massive goal. Third place back to the good side of north London.
"Jermain Defoe almost certainly secures three points for Tottenham. As it stands, #AFC are in third and #THFC fourth."
Just seen Armand Traore's superb run and cross for QPR's goal. Superb stuff from the former Arsenal man. Nice guy & promising footballer.
Gervinho finally replaced by Gibbs for #AFC. He's shown inconsistency in his end product throughout the season. Needs a good pre-season.
Five minutes of Harry Redknapp time? If #AFC hold on third place is ours. Crucial final minutes.

#ff @IndesitUK - Arsenal ticket competitions & more!
Nervy game but #afc finally got their in the end. Three points was desperately needed. Thanks to @IndesitUK for the box seats.
"Mark Hughes said his QPR side were in 'total control' against #AFC yesterday. 21 shots, 11 on target and 70% possession suggests otherwise."
"Marouane Chamakh starts upfront for #afc against #rfc tonight. Walcott, Arshavin, Koscielny, Djourou all play. Gnabry also in the XI."
"Arsenal 3-0 down to Reading. 20 minutes gone. Sluggish, lethargic and defensively shocking. Very poor."
Wow. One of the most amazing comebacks you're ever likely to see this season. Arsenal very fortunate with the late equaliser. 4-4.
It just had to happen didn't it?! Arsenal's Moroccan goal machine Marouane Chamakh makes it 5-4 in extra time. Remarkable comeback.
Over 20 people on my timeline tweeted 'Chamakh will get the winner' at the start of extra time. Arsenal's forgotten man.
#RFC 5-5 #AFC - Enthralling Capital One Cup tie. Pogrebnyak with the equaliser. Chamakh almost got goal no.6 seconds later. Crazy game.
"CRAZY! Theo Walcott wins the game for Arsenal in the last minute of extra time. Determination, passion and a bit of fortune. Amazing."
Andrey Arshavin has completed 120 minutes of football. He's been outstanding today. Reading 5-6 Arsenal.
Moroccan goal machine Marouane Chamakh lobs Federici. Arsenal lead 7-5. Wenger shakes his head in disbelief. What a game.
Full Time: Reading 5-7 Arsenal - The Gunners are through to the quarter-final. Arsenal fans have been brilliant. Great spirit & resolve.

"Arsenal will play a pre-season friendly in Jakarta, Indonesia next summer. (via @RobHarris)."
Vermaelen has made a catalogue of errors since being made captain. #MUFC dominant since van Persie's goal. #AFC need to settle quickly.
Arsenal away fans absolutely superb as always. #MUFC supporters surprisingly quiet despite being 1-0 up. Just over 10 minutes gone.
"Jenkinson, Koscielny, Vermaelen & Sagna are all better left-back options than Santos. The Brazilian is a liability for #afc at the moment."
He's missed it! Rooney skews his effort wide. Massive miss for #MUFC. Can #AFC respond with an improved second half performance?
Half Time: #MUFC 1-0 #AFC - #AFC have looked short of confidence since RvP's early goal. Rooney's penalty miss gives AW's side a lifeline.
Arsenal have been far too amicable towards van Persie from the outset. Save the handshakes for full-time.
"Arsenal concede a second goal & Jack Wilshere gets sent off in the space of 5 minutes. Game over now, surely."
"2-0, and you still don't sing!' chant the Arsenal away fans at Old Trafford. They've been a credit to the club today as always."
"Manchester United 2-0 up at Old Trafford. 70,000+ supporters in the stadium. All that can be heard is 'We love you Arsenal, we do!'. Class."

Plenty of exciting attacking options on the bench for Arsenal. Joel Campbell and Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain the obvious choices. Pace.
Laurent Koscielny makes up for his earlier error with a fantastic header past Speroni. Excellent goal from Arsenal's perspective. 1-1.
Half Time: Arsenal 1-1 Crystal Palace - Hangeland opened the scoring from Palace's first corner of the game. Koscielny equalised on 45 mins.
First Arsenal injury of the season: Kieran Gibbs (hamstring).
Looks like Gibbs was taken off as a precaution. Nacho Monreal replaces him. Giroud & Oxlade-Chamberlain also warming up for #afc.
Full Time: Arsenal 2-1 Crystal Palace - Ramsey's stoppage time tap-in gives Arsenal all three points. Poor performance but a great win.
