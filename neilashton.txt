
Highly unusual website statement by #Arsenal on #Fabregas. Still has to leave for sake of career.
"Sunday colleagues off on safari to see the ""Big Five"" tmrw. They think they're going to see United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs."
"@jloskaterjim72 woud be an amazing signing, Pires was a great player at #Arsenal, #Wenger let him go too soon."
"Best/worst kit so far in pre-season? Still time to change #spurs away, dreadful. nice touch with red detail on cuffs #arsenal home."
"BBC piling on pressure asking for predictions. Any thoughts, other than 1st ref to Fergie Time, Arsenal ""tika-taka football"" or Mancini OBE?"
"Ray Parlour convinced Schwarzer is happening, wouldn't disagree. #arsenal."
#schwarzer fails fitness test... #fulham #arsenal
"Great to see Wilshere playing for #Arsenal today, deserves his chance, talented enough to outshine Joe Cole. #liverpool"
"Shocking decision to send off Joe Cole for that, not that kind of player. This should be one of games of season. #liverpool #arsenal"
"Arsene Wenger, buy a goalkeeper. #arsenal #liverpool"
@sunstevebrenner wenger's been trying to turn into a non-contact sport for years. And each year they never win the league. #arsenal
"Reviewing the morning's papers tomorrow on #talksport from 7am, expecting joe cole, #arsenal and #liverpool to be the big debate."
"#liverpool appeal for joe cole red would be frivolous but even wenger said it ""wasn't deliberate"". #arsenal"

"@sankman no, failed fitness test to play #mufc has a ""bad back"". he's going #arsenal, just not until near deadline, #fulham making him sweat"
@sandeep725 bit of a holding pattern above Ldn. #fulham and #arsenal now relying on #mancity
"#walcott talking impressively today, always seems enthusiastic about being with #england squad. #arsenal"
"@MrNjolinjo #arsenal are not equipped to win #epl. #chelsea are the team for all seasons, plus they have the mental map to win trophies."
"Loving Arsene Wenger's latest haircut, almost as slick as his #arsenal team."
"ray parlour can't leave the dressing room behind, he's just revealed paul dickov's nickname at #arsenal was ""cutya"". dickov hated it."
Wilshere looking so much quicker for #arsenal this season. Over-exuberant challenge on Zigic a result of him running the game.
"Blow for Arsenal and Arsene Wenger, boy from Brazil Wellington Silva denied work permit today."
"For those asking about Wellington Silva home office have work permit department, Arsenal told earlier today he doesn't meet criteria."
Get at Arsenal's central defenders and let them do the rest.
"Please please please call John Cross LIVE tonight on 02076073200, he'll be putting Wenger's wrongs right on Arsenal FC fan phone in."
@neilashton_notw ha... Arsenal and Everton legend.
"@berkeracar at peak of powers he was magic for arsenal, your ""idiot mate"" is on to something. For longevity Giggs wins. Ability Pires."
"Have finally found someone who isn't watching Arsenal v Barcelona. Ever the pro, Mark Hughes at Bolton v Wigan ahead of FAC tie Sunday."
"Wilshere unfazed, best player on the pitch for Arsenal. Walcott will be dragged at half time if he keeps this up."
"Appreciate dialogue, esp re Walcott. Most sent before he was subbed and before Arsenal scored twice."
"Koscielny outstanding for Arsenal, he probably didn't realise he was capable of playing like that."
"Love all the predictable ""official score CL score"" responses. Btw not ""anti-Arsenal"", nor ""anti-Walcott"". Great night for both."
@danielnotaro arsenal have been successful over a long period of time. Put your rivalry to one side for 5 mins.
Someone has to tell Paul Merson Arsenal don't have a player called Wiltshere.
"@rdm_bwfc major questions. Arsenal money men happy to qualify for CL to pay for stadium, no pressure to win trophies"
"@sawyer_arsenal no, I'm serious. Bendtner won't be intimidated by reputations, others will."

"@NorthGooner why is it unnecessary to say arsenal are 8/9 players short of title team if i believe it to be true? re cesc, what sarcasm?"

"@DarrenArsenal1 don't get me started on arsenal, not tonight"
"@JsMills sorry, i was under impression arsenal would dominate chat, i don't set talksport agenda"
at least wilshere gave it a go today. how many arsenal players can stand side by side with him after that performance.

"@YankeeGunner they don't have a single player on £100,000 a week. arsenal full of them when bonuses take into account"
"@Arsenalman2011 arsenal are seasoned CL campaigners, but they're not good enough when it comes to barcelona."
@cjelcapitan best football? i don't agree with that creation any more. i'd go to united and spurs ahead of arsenal now
"@Arsenalman2011 anti-arsenal... sorry, you take it too personally because i said they are 8/9 players away from a PL title."
@Arsenal_Away about the same.
"@Arsenal_Away ""my mate"""
"Thanks to all the Arsenal fans for driving the Harry Redknapp out debate overnight. Hope Spurs fans who feel the same have sobered up, too."
@Sawyer_Arsenal because i told them they're not good enough to win the title with that team. journalist isn't a beauty pageant
"@Arsenal_Away i love in London, but there we are"
"@Arsenal_Away in the past yes, but not any more"
"@Sawyer_Arsenal no, i don't. i don't see emmanuel eboue, squillaci, koscielny, walcott, bendtner etc with title winning medals in same team"

"@Arsenal_Away that's right mate, I'm still hoping to get a game for them"
"@Arsenal_Away when they get a stadium they will have a chance, until then forget it. ""My mate redknapp""..."
Arsenal still 2/3 players short according to Arsene Wenger's apologists. Going to stick with 8 or 9.
"@Arsenal_Away ""my mate""? If you knew the history between us you'd think differently."
"@TheBoyClem thanks pal, you're in a small field of people to say that! Arsenal fans upset again today."
"@kingstonbear it's the power of the message from the manager and board, fans fall for it, arsenal a classic example"
@DanielNotaro my point is that arsenal will never win a significant trophy again under current recruitment policy.
"@DanielNotaro seriously, with exception of ronnie gaucho teams almost equal in 06. What happened to arsenal over next five years?"
"Manchester United, Arsenal and Samir Nasri. Online column: http://bit.ly/kNvJVd"
@RichardCann76 clubs have spoken about Nasri. Arsenal indicated they will not sell until Wenger signs replacements.
"@Gee28Mufc if Arsenal sell now, Nasri+Fabregas cash is £65m. Other clubs will put premium on Arsenal targets."
@zamMUFC19 arsenal don't want to sell to united but what's the alternative if he runs down his contract?
@zamMUFC19 ashley young is on 135k a week at United. They'll pay nasri more and win more trophies than Arsenal.
"@Alisalmanh they have discussed nasri with arsenal but if they sell now, clubs will put premium on arsenal targets."
"@whereswalters1 I don't see that, arsenal want to reconfigure their squad first."
"@StephenBusby88 why's that fella, united have had dialogue with arsenal."
"@StephenBusby88 ha, that's funny. Arsenal told them to wait, they want to find replacements before anything can happen."
"Heading into talkSPORT, 8pm-10pm with Sam Matterface. United, City, Arsenal..."
"@avoidconfusion Ferguson is desperate to get him, always tough to buy from a rival club but it can happen if arsenal find replacements"
"@Miles_Aarhus various theories, but arsenal told united they want time to find replacements before deciding on nasri"
"@GlenGraham2 he wants out of arsenal. tough to call, but fergie made it clear to board last week he wanted nasri."
"@grahambanks i like him, his best performance was CLSF v Arsenal but then bombed v Barca in 09 final."
"@Superman041 they've been in contact, arsenal taking their time, united abit more pressing"
"@holly100789 they don't want to obviously, but arsenal bought silvestre a couple of years back so why not?"
@trixt_uk why not? united sold silvestre to arsenal
"@Superman041 no, I never said that. I said United would bid, they have spoken to Arsenal, and Arsenal told them to wait."
"@Superman041 don't know about player/wenger, but up top clubs have spoken. Arsenal want replacements. Alternative is convince him to stay"
"@rattaz79 is it that straightforward? Arsenal have to believe their squad will improve by signing players to replace him, which isn't easy"
"Gervinho one of the signings of the summer. Great value, top quality and will make an instant impact at Arsenal."
"@mufcwp clubs have spoken about nasri, arsenal want to wait."

Talking about the great Patrick Vieira on FiveLive just after 730pm. Should make supporters of Arsenal and Manchester City happy...
Looking forward to speaking with the legendary @johncrossmirror live from Arsenal's pre-season tour on talkSPORT at 330pm.
"@Arsenalman2011 not my fault arsenal can't win a trophy pal, that's down to the manager."
"ASHTON | talkSPORT from 3pm-5pm with Ian Danter. All the big issues, including Gervinho - the signing of the summer for Arsenal."
"@MickTheGooner signing contract protects both parties. He's been at arsenal for 8yrs, that's half a career. Get rid and move on"
"@MickTheGooner I don't agree with his pre-season attitude but mostly has given his all, so don't see why arsenal holding out. £30m."
@MattWigley my only argument against is that arsenal will make a profit on him regardless of fee.
"@Jimmisav andy carroll isn't worth £30m. Arsenal should sell and move on, it's shocking the club's captain is not involved at EC this w/e"
"@MickTheGooner I think arsenal should repay fabregas loyalty, which has been almost unequivocal for 8ys."
"@MickTheGooner the point being is that he's done his time, just let him go. £30m is almost £30m more than arsenal paid for him."
"@Hesfivefootfour according to board arsenal already have the money, quibbling with barca over £5m will lose you a title not win it."
"@Silts81 arsenal want £35m, why do fans think he's worth £60m then."
"@Silts81 for club captain his attitude is scandalous, I don't understand why arsenal fans so willingly accept this behaviour."
"@Silts81 ideally you'd get more, but this disruption and sideshow will affect arsenal's season."
"@GomezGooner sorry, lots of other arsenal fans getting upset now, what was it?"
Apologies. Diaby not Song. Worryingly I was at Newcastle 4 Arsenal 4 as well.
"@Sawyer_Arsenal come on, give me a chance"
Watch your team for a tenner. Brilliant Football League initiative in today's Sun. Nice contrast to £100 top price ticket at Arsenal.
@HarlowGooner no problem at all. The point being is the most expensive tickets in PL are at Arsenal and cost £100.
"@HarlowGooner just making a point about price differential. Arsenal fans a little over sensitive at the moment, perhaps for good reason."
"@Arsenal_Away er, no I didn't."
"@Arsenal_Away I don't need to deny something I never said. Alan said he was on holiday. I know it was early, but wakey wakey."
"@ibby_dj at the risk of upsetting a few arsenal fans again, I think they're willing to sell now."
@Arsenal_Away shame you reach that conclusion simply because I don't share your belief in a manager's philosophy.
@Arsenal_Away if one of them made me an offer I'd be able to tell you.
"@paulcoog you think fabregas wanted to go to barca because the media brainwashed him? No, it's because he can't win trophies at arsenal"
"@Cfcaway wish I'd been there, but it clashed with arsenal and had to go there instead..."

"Is there a goodbye message for Sami from Arsenal fans before he signs a £220,000 a week contract?"
@timothysansom in Wenger's mind he doesn't have any failings. To my mind The Project is over and sadly so is his time as Arsenal manager.
"Some good news for Arsenal fans, Santos work permit agreed."
"Already looking forward to an airing of ""Arteta for England"" after a couple of half-decent matches for Arsenal..."
@Sawyer_Arsenal in Dougie we trust.
"@bluwhit heading into talkSPORT at 10pm for the final knockings. Arsenal's approach today is desperation measures, the end of The Project."
"Panic over, Arsenal's long-term future is secure. Arsenal's U10s beat Chelsea U10s 11-0 today in an academy match, 20mins each way."
@Arsenal_Away you're hard to please.
"@Arsenal_Away great idea, although it always seemed to upset arsenal fans for some reason."
"@Arsenal_Away seriously I don't agree with the blind faith, that's all!"
"@Joeslovebus ha, you should have come to say hello. Must admit I was aware of a few looks, but I was with Arsenal supporting friends"
"@Arsenal_Away sorry, forgot how well things have been going over the past 5 years"
"@Arsenal_Away I respect the club and its achievements, I've never believed Wenger's post 05 philosophy will lead to trophies"
"@Arsenal_Away not really sure what your point is, I've been trying to do that for a decade."
"@DanielSlavin I referenced Steven Howard's column in the Sun today, then said Arsenal won't win trophies with current philosophy."
"@Arsenal_Away it could have been avoided, but he broke up a successful team too early and brought in meek replacements"
"@Asyd_rrein ha, I need to ask arsenal fans for immunity for one night as I'm sitting with them for the olympiakos game."
"@Arsenal_Away he will have to get his allegations through lawyers etc, don't think that will be easy, but he says he has the documents."
"@Arsenal_Away realistically done what I wanted, which was to find an agent who walked away from the game. TV his next step apparently"
"@Arsenal_Away yes mate, they all granted me immunity and were very kind to me."
"@mcfclaura I'm a traditionalist, I'm sticking with Hyde United... Bit like Woolwich Arsenal etc"
@Sawyer_Arsenal did you lose again yesterday or is this just a courtesy call?
"@TerrenceTheCat losing like that to arsenal - at home - was a one off, I'm sure of it."

"George Graham on LBC: ""arsenal finishing fourth this season would be weng's greatest achievement..."""
"Hugely dignified and honourable, GG also said ""wenger best manager in arsenal's history""."
"@Reillypatr he's good, but not good enough for arsenal. Like most of the players."
@johncrossmirror how annoyed are you - i can't spot an Arsenal connection on the pitch anywhere.
"Ashamed to admit I thought Arsenal were only 6 or 7 players short last season. On reflection, it's a whole squad."
"@bladered arsenal are finished under current philosophy, been saying it for 5 years pal."
"@jaygor1 look at results since 2007, arsenal are out of the game."
Arsenal fans may want Wenger to leave but these players are his signings. Defy anyone to improve results with such an average group.
"@Brett_leverton they are good, but not good enough for arsenal Brett - that is the simple test. Irrelevant whether they get in bolton team."
"@rishi_sidhu ramsey, walcott etc are squad players at a club with arsenal's history. They need quality, plus regrettably a new manager"
"@W3104_ come on, please... Don't fall into that trap. Under Wenger's current philosophy Arsenal will never compete for top trophies"
"@Pigeon1873 wage cap?? Henry was earning 130k a week when he left, arsenal wages over 100m a year"

"RT: @premierleague: ""I want to get us back to the level of the Invincibles."" - Wenger on Arsenal's 20 seasons best team."
"@DanPowellAFC no, but I don't believe arsenal will win major trophies under current recruitment policy. Good players are not good enough."
"@BuzDunworth I meant that it was a tap-in to give arsenal a cuff over the invincibles, which is why I ignored the temptation"
"@Arsenal_Away thanks, enjoyed seeing Capello for a couple of hours. I'm with Sharapova when it comes to twitter at this moment."
"Can understand why official attendance at Wembley is claimed to be 70,584: they have borrowed Arsenal's stadium announcer. #60,000"

@Arsenal_Away lovely turn of phrase ;
"@Arsenal_Away none taken, made me laugh"
"Great to see @johncrossmirror at an Arsenal press conference this morning, just like old times. Delighted to report nothing has changed."
Pretty sure Arsenal's supporters heard Ivan Gazidis say all this last year... And the year before...
"Are Arsenal fans right to criticise Kroenke, Gazidis, Wenger? Sportsmail's top team give their view in tmrw's edition/online from 11pm."
@martinjfiler problem for arsenal is that he has more ability on the ball than Walcott or ox-chamberlain
"Back on talksport right now... @johncrossmirror. Talking Arsenal, I think"
Arsenal fans have every right to demand answers to that question about Ivan Gazidis.
@BlairStripOne arsenal are a high profile london club with fantastic history and pedigree - easy to negotiate commercial deals.
"@NeilPayne I agree with that, but the media adore him. He's a nice, incredibly charming man - but he's been at Arsenal too long."
@NeilPayne I've been pretty isolated on the subject - I said in 07 arsenal will never win a major trophy under current recruitment policy.
"@Always__Arsenal no, out and out winger, ronaldinho-type."

Just the one wish left in life: can Arsenal and Theo Walcott spare us all by ending this contract saga.
"@Famlan as long as Arsene keeps Arsenal in the top four everyone gets paid, including his £7m a year salary, that's why."
"@Super_G_ I'm afraid I've been saying it for years. Nice guy, finished at Arsenal."

"@terrybyfield @mikesinnerton bit presumptious, although I would expect us to beat arsenal away the way we're playing... ;-)"
