#Kieran Gibbs goes off injured half-way through the first half of England Under-21 friendly in Lithuania. More bad news for #Arsenal

"Meanwhile, yet another London Premier League team lets a lead slip. Arsenal, Chelsea, West Ham, Spurs - they're all at it this season..."
Man Utd (AC Milan) and Chelsea (Inter Milan) could be in trouble. Arsenal (Porto) will be delighted. Liverpool set for Europa League draw
Five defeats before Christmas for United. Villa jump above Arsenal into third. This is shaping up to be a cracking Premier League season...
Plenty of empty seats among home fans at Upton Park. Arsenal supporters busy serenading Alex Song in last match before Africa Cup of Nations
Arsenal very much on top of West Ham at Upton Park. Under-strength Hammers struggling to get into game. Striker Nouble starved of service
West Ham growing in confidence with Arsenal struggling to keep hold of ball. Hosts almost get in on goal when Wilshere twice loses possesion
Mikael Silvestre gets an absolute earful from Arsenal fans after woeful attempt at playing Diamanti offside leads to West Ham going 1-0 up
Error-ridden Arsenal being exposed by hungry & sharp West Ham. Merida & Silvestre being slated by away supporters. Arsenal struggling badly
Wenger brings on Diaby & Nasri for Merida & Wilshere and Arsenal are transformed. Ramsy & Eduardo give Gunners a scarcely deserved lead
RT: @ArsenalDotCom Sol Campbell named in Arsenal Reserve team to play West Ham tonight - http://bit.ly/5WXMnO
Just spoken to #Arsenal centre-back Philippe Senderos. He wants to leave permanently in Jan for 1st team #football ahead of #WorldCup2010
#Everton agree a deal to sign #Senderos from #Arsenal on loan until end of season: http://bit.ly/7oOAhG #football
"#Arsenal squad stepping off the bus at Villa Park has remarkably diff look to that at Stoke on Sun. Likes of GC, WG, TV, BS, SN, NB all back"
"Aston Villa - Luke Young in for Warnock. Arsenal - strongest available side with Bendtner, Nasri, Walcott and Campbell on bench"
"Villa make a strong counter-attacking start against Arsenal. Agbonlahor denied by Almunia's fingertips, Young curls a free-kick just wide"
Fabregas beats 2 men and drills a shot across goal but it comes back off the post. Rare Arsenal attack. Villa by far the better side
Could Arsenal be about to lose another player to injury. Eduardo replaced by Bendtner. Rosicky smashes a shot against the bar. Open half
#AstonVilla 0-0 #Arsenal. Here's the report: http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8473143.stm #football
"BREAKING NEWS: #Arsenal centre-back Thomas Vermaelen has a suspected broken fibula, according to Gunners boss Arsene Wenger #football"
#Arsenal fear defender Vermaelen has broken leg: http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/8484274.stm
United's demolition of Arsenal will leave Wenger with some serious head-scratching. Seems the days of his team matching SAF's are long gone
"#Arsenal news: Eboue in for Sagna, Bendtner replaces Walcott for first start since Oct. #Liverpool news: Skrtel in for Krygiakos. #football"
"Fairly dour first half at Emirates. #Arsenal look nervous, #Liverpool solid and confident. Got to hope this explodes into life in 2nd period"
Arsenal-Liverpool has burst into life in the second half. Diaby heads #Arsenal into a 1-0 lead. #Liverpool pressing for an equaliser
#Arsenal 1-0 #Liverpool. What was your verdict? Here's the write-up: http://bit.ly/cjTtGN #football
Miss of the season contender from #Birmingham. #Arsenal v lucky to escape #football
Nasri. Birmingham 0-1 Arsenal
Phillips 250th league goal. Birmingham 1-1 Arsenal
#Fabregas misses training & faces late fitness test ahead of #Barcelona. Will surely play. Gallas back in squad after 7wks out #Arsenal
Barca completely dominating early stages. Messi on fire. Arsenal look nervous wreck. Could be a painful night fot Gunners. Ibra woeful miss
Ibrahimovic puts Alves cross over from an unmarked position 6 yards out. #Barca should be 1-0 up. Barca's high pressing troubling #Arsenal
"Loose Diaby pass allows Alves to set Ibra free but drills into side netting. Arsenal fans getting v tetchy, getting on Diaby's back already"
"It's fair to say Barca should be winning 3-0 or 4-0 after 15 mins. Barca a diff class, Arsenal awful. Crowd rightly singing Almunia's name"
Arsenal eventually settle into some sort of tempo and Nasri fires inches wide. Eboue coming on for someone... maybe Arshavin who's hobbling
"Arsenal's injuries probs worsen. Denilson on for Gallas (1st game in 7 weeks with 2 days traininf, why start him?!?) Arsenal hanging on"
"One mistake is understandable bt never make the same mistake twice. Arsenal let Ibra in again down right channel. 2-0 Barca, richly deserved"
"How Arsenal weren't well beaten we'll never know. Barca switched off, Arsenal showed amazing spirit to draw 2-2. Cesc & Puyol out of 2nd leg"
@KernowChris It's looking more likely than not. United obviously stand a better chance than Arsenal but both games are very tricky to call
Off to the Emirates for #Arsenal v #Wolves? Predictions welcome... #football
Arsenal should be 2-0 up. At least. Rosicky crosses for Eduardo 6 yrds out but he completely miscues. Sagna races through bt shot well saved
Arsenal fans getting increasingly frustrated at their team's inability to break down a stubborn Wolves defence. Visitors quite comfortable
"Wolves resisting wave after wave of Arsenal attacks, aided by Walcott's woeful crossing and a lack of plan B from the Gunners"
Arsenal physio calls Nicklas Bendtner back from his warm-up to get stripped off. The Dane's coming on by the looks of it. But for who?
"Arsenal's game-plan: break from midfield, knock it right to Walcott, lose posession, start again. Jones puts a free-kick straight at Almunia"
Desperate times for Arsenal at the Emirates. Wolves defending for their lives by hook or by crook. Arsenal's title bid over if they dont win
