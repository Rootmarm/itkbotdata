
Why does it seem that everyone with a 'normal' job has the day off? Arsenal Tweets now following me. Best beware what I say about Arsenal...
At Arsenal training ahead of today's press conference. Arsene Wenger has had long chats with Adebayor and Bendtner. Interesting...
Arsenal so short of numbers that youth teamer Conor McCormack joins the group. Not involved tomorrow though...
Chelsea v Liverpool. A classic - what a game. Arsenal have a lot to live up to on Weds night!
Arsenal previews from the training ground tomorrow... Wenger's running out of players!
Just about to watch Arsenal train... Hoping for some good team news!
Up early for Setanta Sports newspaper review. Big day for Theo and Co but they're confident. Arsenal could've signed Drogba for 100k!
Arsenal: fabianski, eboue, toure, silvestre, gibbs, theo, denilson, cesc, diaby, rvp, adebayor. Risky...
 Didier Drogba gets the better of Arsenal. Again. Fair result though, I think.think 
Adebayor rested for Arsenal at Liverpool tomorrow
 Looking forward to Liverpool v Arsenal tonight. Draw, me thinks... 
Arsenal press conference tomorrow. Stay tuned for an update after lunch...
I wouldn't have given Arsenal much chance against Man United two weeks ago. But now... It's going to be a classic...
Arsenal got away with it. Tie should be over.
 Silent Stan buys about 50m worth of shares, making him the main shareholder of Arsenal with 28 per cent. Yankee Doodle Dandy 
Arsenal's second string humiliated Portsmouth who were so poor. They'll be relegated next season.
 At Arsenal training. RvP trains, major boost... 
Arsenal thoroughly beaten over two legs. Illustrates a huge gulf between Arsenal and United. Wenger needs more experience like Arshavin.
 Arsenal need players. Wenger must buy a centre half, central midfielder and replacement for Ade$&?@r. 
@djamesc gotta replace Adebayor if Arsenal wanna challenge. Can't believe Chelsea would be keen if they'd watched him this season
Cesc Fabregas pledges his future to Arsenal. Now Arsenal need to dig deep to challenge next season. Three big players required. #Arsenal
 Was told Arsenal after player who plays in France, isn't French and had great season. Thought may be Sakho but he's French. Ideas? #arsenal 
 I don't understand footballers. Four days after pledging his loyalty to Arsenal, Cesc says an offer from Barca would be 'special.' #arsenal 
A difference in loyalty. Clichy dismisses Real Madrid interest. Sagna 'wouldn't be against it.' Clichy's commitment underlined. #arsenal
Cesc pledges future to Arsenal. How significant was it making him captain? He must be desperate for a big season. #arsenal
After thought on cesc. Next time a Spanish journalist asks about Real Madrid... Dodge it! Makes life easier. #arsenal
 Big, big test for Theo Walcott. Can he be England's main man against Germany tonight? #arsenal 
Met Arsenal fan 2nite who lost the tops of both index fingers trying to jump over a fence after losing to Chelsea at wembley. Urgh! #arsenal
 Biggest hit on Mirror website today was Ade story
#arsenal 
Usmanov's offer to inject millions into Arsenal to reduce debt and give Wenger SERIOUS money to spend is rejected by board. #arsenal
City give up on Eto'o. Will they now turn to Adebayor? A similar mercenary. #arsenal #man city
Gr8 contrast between way Arsenal treat Kroenke and Usmanov. Usmanov frozen out. Kroenke will launch full takeover bid within year. #arsenal
Don't think Man City will have any probs persuading Adebayor to give up Champs Lge football. Show me the money! #arsenal #man city #adebayor
@Rukz0304 Hi. Thanks so much 4 yr tweet! I agree - Arsenal always take so long over deals/contracts. I do think Arse have got Chamakh tho
Chamakh will be great replacement for Ade. Rarely have I known Arsenal fans so excited about selling a player - hope 4 u all Ade goes asap
 @JoePescii Hi. I try to be neutral - and with my twitter! Sorry. People always guess wrong. Spurs think I'm Arsenal, Arsenal think I'm Spurs 
Chelsea strongly denying any interest in Adebayor - a story floating around in one or two of tomorrow's English papers. #adebayor #arsenal
Adebayor desperate for Milan or another club to come in. That should serve as a warning to #mancity Arsenal desperate to sell #arsenal
@Neil_Ashton About as popular as an Arsenal/Adebayor shirt! How's KL?
Have never had so many gleeful messages about Adebayor going. A very popular departure. Don't criticise Arsenal for selling him. #arsenal
 Adebayor: My first choice was Man City. Sums the guy up. A joker. City fans - sorry, but he ain't the real deal. #arsenal #mancity 
 At Four Seasons hotel, Beverley Hills. Mourinho, Vieira and Klinsmann in the foyer. Bit star struck. #arsenal #Chelsea #spurs 
 Rarely do footballers surprise u. Adebayor takes biscuit. Poor £80,000-a-week says the fans   were not nice at all.   Ah, diddums. #arsenal 
 @MartinL2828 I'm doing the pre-season tour but am based in London so do Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham etc. London football basically. 
Man City turn to Kolo Toure after missing out on John Terry. City ready to do a £12m deal. Could open door for Hangeland & Arsenal. #arsenal
 Vieira back to Arsenal would be masterstroke. At 33, PV can no longer scale the heights but would be great for the dressing room. #arsenal 
Can't believe bloggers taking Wenger seriously about no more signings. A genius but proven liar on transfers. Does it every window. #arsenal
There'll be signings. AW doesn't want 2 let people know he's buying or prices go up. People still take him at face value. Naive. #arsenal
 Right. Gonna stop talking about Vieira now! Arsenal need character/s. No, really... Gonna stop! 
PlusMarket announces shift in shares... Fiszman to Kroenke. Stan's takeover edges ever closer. He'll be main man by next year. #arsenal
Wenger dropping big hints today that Vieira could return... And Chamakh appears to be underway. #arsenal
Arshavin scores. 1-0. Russian genius. #arsenal
Just imagine Arshavin and Vieira... 1-1 by the way... #arsenal
2-1 arshavin!!! Crazy. #arsenal
 Senderos to Everton, Chamakh to Arsenal, Lescott to City. Things hotting up! #arsenal #everton #mancity 
Will Rosicky ever get back to what he was..? I doubt it. Terrific player at his peak. #arsenal
 Sorry, Celtic. But can only see one winner: Arsenal. Gap is growing. Wenger will be happy, Mowbray depressed. #arsenal #Celtic 
Djourou's injury plus other knocks shows how threadbare Arsenal squad is. Don't expect any trophies without more signings. #arsenal
Dubious as to whether Arsenal have pulled out of Chamakh. They don't wanna pay 8m - even tho their ticket prices are sky high! #arsenal
@Rotimi_Kuforiji Still think he's no1. That Arsenal thing 'we won't pay big fees - but charge fans loads to watch cheap players' amazes me
 Arsenal fans remember: Wenger nvr does business early. Drives late, hard deals. Chamakh, Hangeland, Vieira, Matuidi still in frame. #arsenal 
How many times did Wenger try to bluff  that Arshavin deal was off?! Don't be fooled. He still wants Chamakh - just at right price. #arsenal
Most interesting thing from Wenger's interview on Times' website...? That his favourite film is The Deer Hunter. A classic movie. #arsenal
Off to #Portsmouth v #Fulham. I fear for Pompey - could go down. Fulham need to keep Hangeland but #arsenal hovering. Score draw at Fratton
Hangeland has made 2 great blocks for #Fulham. But his distribution is appalling. Is he a 12m player? No. Is he an #Arsenal type player? No
@dJfLiCkY I think it's more likely he'll stay at Fulham. Arsenal don't want to pay 12m plus.
#Arsenal undoubtedly had result of weekend. But #mancity also showed they mean business. Drogba showed he's back for #Chelsea. Tight race
 Off to Glasgow Monday. Follow my tweets for team news, gossip, press conference, preview etc for #Celtic vs #Arsenal 
 Just landed in Glasgow. BMI have succeeded in opening my bag, losing my luggage tag and thoroughly annoying me. Press con afta 4. #arsenal 
 Rare I moan about newspaper coverage, but should mention that 2 teams played at Goodison. Not just Everton. #Arsenal deserve more praise. 
Arsene Wenger in confident mood at press conference. He believes Arsenal's spirit will help them through Celtic cauldron. #arsenal
Arsenal without Theo after Walcott suffers injury setback. Diaby fit and I think he may start. #arsenal
Mowbray love in with Wenger. Celtic boss full of praise for him. No English team has won at Celtic since Forest 26 yrs ago. #arsenal
 My debut at #Celtic Park - what a noise! #Arsenal came through. Vermaelen, Song, Cesc outstanding. They're showing promise for season... 
 Off to #Arsenal press conference today,  to see Arsene Wenger for all the news ahead of Portsmouth game. I'll tweet so stay tuned! #Arsenal 
 Eduardo is back in the squad - and may start. Wenger   rubbishes   latest Cesc/Barca stories. Wenger also bigging up Song's progress. #arsenal 
 Theo out for next 2 weeks and next #England WC qualifier. Wenger upset Walcott went to under-21s.   England will pay price.   #Arsenal 
Good interview with Gael Clichy in Sat Mirror/web. He hails importance of Wenger and desire to win trophy this season. Next #Arsenal captain
Wenger admits he's still interested in Vieira. 'Until Aug 31 it's still possible.' Also wants a defender. May get Matuidi too. #arsenal
I still think Chamakh is on Wenger radar despite denials. He also dismissed Arshavin rumours in Jan and look what happened... #arsenal
@brainopops Arsenal v Portsmouth. It's such an obvious result - that Pompey might cause an upset! What are you up to?
Am off to #Arsenal v #Portsmouth today. It's such an obvious home win that I reckon there just be a surprise...
 Wenger rests Song, Sagna, Clichy and Bendtner. Gibbs, Eboue, Diaby and Eduardo all in. Bit of a gamble. Draw on cards... #arsenal 
 Great win for #Arsenal, shame Cesc limped off with hammy. Could be worse - could be #Portsmouth. Takeover turmoil and fans deserve better 
Arsenal training and press conference on Tues morning. Please follow the build up to the #Celtic game. #Arsenal
Cesc Fabregas misses training - major blow. Out for #celtic and #manunited on saturday and up to 3 weeks. But Rosicky trains. #Arsenal
 Wenger talking after 12. Follow press con on my twitter and at wwwmmirrorfootball.co.uk
#arsenal 
 Wenger gives Cesc chance of being fit for #manunited, says #Celtic job 'not done' and shock at Sol. Read at mirrorfootball website. #arsenal 
 Wenger says if Senderos goes then he will replace him. If not, Senderos will rejoin the first team. Think PS wants fresh start. #arsenal 
Wenger hails sharper RvP. #Arsenal are genuine CL contenders. Says it's 'vital' they reach Group stages. Read MirrorFootball site/paper
Champs League Group stages may open door for new signings. But Senderos departure will hold key. Mirrorfootball website/ paper. #arsenal
Off to #Arsenal v #Celtic. Me thinks 2-1 home win. Follow me through the game...
 Wenger: This game's bigger than  Man U. Er, van Persie and Arshavin left on bench. Eduardo, Eboue start in 4-4-2. #Arsenal should still win 
 Distin set for £4m #Everton switch... That's no-go to Ev for Senderos. Villa, Sunderland, Fulham and one other watching Philippe... #arsenal 
 My Thursday column on
I'll be writing on O'Neill and Villa fans, Wenger's new #Arsenal tactic, Harry & Sol. #spurs 
Amazing miss by Eduardo. 0-0 and 10 gone. #arsenal
 Celtic in these shirts look like Borussia Dortmund! Arsenal have started well, Gallas in the mood. #arsenal 
Eduardo - had to be a dive! Penalty! Eduardo scores 1-0. #arsenal
Stewards getting busy with Celtic shirts in home end. Shame they don't get busy with offensive chanting... #arsenal
 Gallas in brilliant form, loving his forays forward. Arsenal playing with great confidence. Watch out #manunited. Still 1-0. #arsenal 
Arsenal 1 up at half time thanks to Eduardo's dodgy pen. 3-0 on agg. Cruise control. #arsenal
Andy Townsend called Eduardo a 'cheat' on ITV. Tomorrow's headlines may not be too pleasant for Eduardo. Hard to defend that. #arsenal
 Eboue 2-0. Then booked for putting his Arsenal shirt above his head. Religious T shirt or not, a stupid yellow card. #arsenal 
Arsenal 3-0 after sub Arshavin magic. Easy street. Let you know what Wenger says later. Will he have seen Eduardo's dive?! #arsenal
 Ramsey limps off with 5 to go. #Arsenal had used all 3 subs, down to ten men. They could have played 90 mins with ten men and still won... 
 All over. Arsenal 3 (Eduardo pen 26, Eboue 53, Arshavin 74) Celtic 1 (Donati 90) 5-1 agg. Gallas mom. #Arsenal confident for #manunited. 
Donati's injury time strike an absolute peach! #Arsenal thru to Thurs draw. What price #manunited v Ronaldo? All 4 English clubs top seeds
 Wenger defends Eduardo, claiming he didn't dive. Celtic incensed. Headlines won't make pleasant reading for Eduardo in morning. #arsenal 
#Arsenal fans are looking for excuses for Eduardo. He dived - end of story. Sometimes it's sporting and better to admit it!
@farrukhx Ronaldo dive at Bolton last yr. Styles apologised. Ronaldo got slaughtered. No anti-Arsenal bias. U just follow AFC stories closer
@arseblog Pundits slaughtered for diving at Bolton last Sept. Got even more coverage than Eduardo. Selective memories. No anti-Arsenal bias
 Pls remember: Every Arsenal fan thinking I'm slaughtering Eduardo - Spurs fans think I hate 'em too. And Chelsea, West Ham etc. No bias here 
AZ Alkmaar in with Arsenal. Arsene will be happy. Bet he saw that one...
 Olympiakos go in with AZ Alkmaar and Arsenal. Wenger will be laughing. Easy street. Last group - Milan, Real Madrid and Marseille 
Arsenal get Standard Liege. So that's Alkmaar and Olympiakos. I saw Arsenal thrash Standard Liege in Belgium a few years back....
Quick quiz question... Which Republic of Ireland international scored for Arsenal that night when Arsenal won 7-0 if my memory serves me...
 United have got Moscow, Besiktas and Wolfsburg. Beware United - Wolfsburg striker Dzeko is brilliant. Arsenal wanted him but out of range 
Arsenal and Chelsea will be happiest. Really tough for Liverpool. United will get through but hard games for Fergie. Fancy all 4 to get thru
@Aphiss They showed Arsenal reps as soon as they were out of the hat. But just no-one recognises them! See - it's that paranoia again...
 Fabregas hoping to train, hoping to be fit, would be major boost for #Arsenal. Would be great to see full strength #Arsenal and a classic. 
Wow. Wenger really goes for UEFA. He's right. If UEFA go for Eduardo - they must show consistency and go for every diver & cheat. #arsenal
Disappointing for #Arsenal that Wenger has ruled out Cesc. Diaby has huge potential - but needs to start showing it! Draw me thinks.
Dear oh dear Diaby. Hard to believe #Arsenal played so well and lost. Wenger then sent off. No common sense. Major boost for #manunited
MotD didn't ask Wenger about his sending off or pen decisions! Incredible. How many years is it now Weng has said #Arsenal lack experience?!
 Still think Wenger will look to do one last deal for #Arsenal. Vieira, Chamakh or a c/ half. But Senderos still there despite everything... 
My word... UEFA have opened a can of worms! And what will #Celtic players say about McGeady's sending off? Consistency please! #Arsenal
Adebayor praises #mancity fans for their support. Don't be fooled. It won't last. #Arsenal fans saw right through him.
 Manuel Almunia is here at # England training at London Colney. Wearing an #Arsenal top and on a different pitch, mind you! 
 My online column at 
Also on those vile Wenger chants - gotta stop it. #arsenal 
#England striker Wayne Rooney also on his big year for #manunited and country. Plus his views on diving. #Arsenal fans won't like it!
 Good to see #Arsenal spending their huge, er, wealth... No 7 in football rich list - what's all that about? 
 Fergie enters diving row with common sense and backing for new pal Wenger, saying every boss backs their players, even cheats. #arsenal 
 Swedish press is awash with Freddie Ljungberg coming back to #Arsenal this winter...  Just to train during MLS break at best, me thinks 
@DanSilverMirror Am afraid there's no chance of him wearing an Arsenal shirt! Just in his dreams... Shall I twitter from Wembley?
Even if Usmanov buys Nina's shares it's non-starter cos other shareholders won't sell. Then has to sell back at top rate. A no-go. #arsenal
Wenger gonna regret not buying now Djourou out for six months. Major blow. #Arsenal really short of defensive cover and have thin squad
 At #England training at #Arsenal training grnd. Fabio on his mobile, Wenger waved at me, Nasri walking freely no plastercast, Walcott back. 
 #Arsenal hoping Walcott back in squad for Sat, possibly starting in the Champs League. He's got task on his hands to win back Eng place 
Great games today. #mancity v #arsenal then #spurs v #manunited. Latter always a cracker. Fancy spurs more likely to crack top four
 Sounds like the FA will come down harder on Adebayor for the alleged stamp on RvP than the celebration. Bad, bad day for #Arsenal. 
Just watched #Adebayor celebration for 15th time and it gets madder every time! He never put that effort in once last season for #Arsenal !
 As for #Adebayor alleged stamp on RvP... Just shocking. Gotta be a long, long ban. He's trouble with a capital T. #Arsenal 
 Saw Chiles, Keown, Dixon at Fulham. Bit of an #Arsenal feel to MotD2 tonight maybe? 
A remarkable decision by UEFA on Eduardo. The biggest U-turn in the history of the European game. Eduardo can now play v Liege. #Arsenal
 Van persie, almunia, denilson all out for liege. Manone in goal. #arsenal 
 Strong words from Wenger on Adebayor in build up to Liege game. #Arsenal need a result. RvP, Denilson, Walcott, Almunia out. Mannone starts 
Check out Standard Liege midfielder Axel Witsel. Banned for 8games for horror Eduardo style tackle but plays in CL v #Arsenal. Priorities..
Standard Liege have problems too. Defour is their best player and he's out injured. So still expect #Arsenal to get a result.
Amazing #Arsenal stat. Almunia has saved just 53percent of shots on target this season. Or he's let in half shots on goal. Bring on Mannone!
#Arsenal take big gamble on starting with Rosicky - his first start since Jan 2008. Sagna drops to bench. Dropped?
Cruel irony of Eduardo making a Sunday League mistake and then a stupid penalty. 0-2 #Arsenal see European ambitions put in perspective
#Arsenal got away with it tonight after woeful first half. Written in the stars that Eduardo would score the winner. Wenger hails spirit.
 Seen the Fabregas scars up close and they look really, really bad. Sorry but it makes Adebayor's excuses this morning seem a joke. #Arsenal 
Adebayor misguided if he thinks #Arsenal fans are upset because he was sold. More to do with not trying last season etc! Such arrogance
 Much made of #Arsenal fans singing bad songs to Ade at City. Ad I understand it, song was Arshavin version rather than elephants. Correct? 
Off to #Arsenal press conference will update on team news later...
RvP returns for #Arsenal. Almunia still out so Mannone. Walcott has had a setback and is still out.
Wenger admitted he'd be interested in signing Chamakh in Jan as well as saying Senderos will def start vs WBA on Tues. #Arsenal
Wenger praises Eboue 9months on from Wigan nightmare. Eboue has turned things around at #Arsenal. But still plenty of room for improvement
 Off to #Arsenal v #Wigan and then #Chelsea v #Spurs. Fancy Arsenal and Chelsea, but wouldn't be surprised if Spurs nick a point tomorrow 
 #Arsenal 1 #Wigan 0. Vermaelen header 25 mins. Arsenal better team, but goal came at right time. 
#Arsenal 2-0 Vermaelen again. Cracker. Has been a great signing.
 3-0 eduardo, easy street for #Arsenal 
 Eboue given 3rd after deflection. #Arsenal 3 #Wigan 0. Booed a year ago, Eboue hero today. Vermaelen outstanding, RvP v good. Rosicky on 
Beautiful goal by Fabregas. 4-0 to #Arsenal. #Wigan boss Martinez practically surrendered b4 game by writing off games vs top 4
Can't think of a more frustrating player than Abou Diaby? Hugely talented but either can't be bothered or is off form most weeks. #arsenal
 Great stuff from Thierry on Adebayor in Sunday Mirror. Ade could learn so much from Henry, a genuine world class player and #Arsenal legend 
 Senderos makes his comeback for #Arsenal v WBA in Carling Cup. 16 month absence, thought he was going this summer - deserves good reception 
 Di Matteo blamed Wilshire for Thomas sending off. Vela made all the difference for #Arsenal. Wenger said of Vela:   He's class.   
Think there's more chance of Adebayor going back to #Arsenal than #Spurs signing Sol.
Arshavin and Walcott return for #Arsenal squad for trip to Fulham. Almunia still out. Wenger hinted Szczesny may start ahead of Mannone.
 Wenger also hit back at Bordeaux president Triaud claims that #Arsenal tapped up Chamakh.   I can look at myself in the mirror.   
 RvP is telling the truth. Strikers take a nudge, they go down. It's different from diving. He was honest, he doesn't deserve flak. #Arsenal 
Don't think we'll see Theo today. Shame. Maybe bench on Tues. Think Wenger is holding him back too long. He's fit and raring to go! #arsenal
Off to Craven Cottage now for #Fulham v #Arsenal. Think Arsenal may get frustrated again. But maybe they will get a point off Fulham
#Arsenal 1-0 rvp winner. Mannone man of match. #Fulham fans give their team standing ovation. Great support.
I'm off to #Arsenal press conference this morning and will have latest team news ahead of #Olympiakos. Check back late morning and lunchtime
Why on earth is Mart Poom at #Arsenal training ground? Goalkeeping crisis takes a new twist...
No Almunia again but Walcott is out there training. 21 players training today. Senderos is there as is Wilshere. Wenger talks l8r. #arsenal
 Denilson out for 2 months, Bendtner and Walcott also miss Olympiakos. #Arsenal 
On Talksport now - lots of #Arsenal chat! #Liverpool too
 Wenger: I've got cash, but don't wanna spend it! Misguided skinflint or genius? Surely they can't win title. Yr thoughts pls! #Arsenal 
 Wenger overtakes George Allison as longest serving #Arsenal boss on Thursday. But Wenger admits: This is pivotal season for   my policy   
Comfortable 2-0 win for #Arsenal in the end. Can't be many better bargains than RvP. But Arsenal went back to trying to walk it into net...
 @arseblog I think it's a big season, I really do. Wenger seemed to accept that when he spoke with us on Mon. Think Arsenal need more quality 
 Got Wenger's transfer policy in my sights for my online column tomorrow at www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
Great #Arsenal boss, but big year 
Don't underestimate Kroenke's latest share buying. All about positioning for takeover. He'll be next owner of #Arsenal
@BadbeatGooner He's frugal in his other sports so he won't be a sugar daddy. I like the tradition of Arsenal but times are achanging
Off to #Arsenal training ground for presser at lunchtime. Let you know latest team news...
 Wenger says Henry will return to #Arsenal one day after he retires from playing. Mannone stays in goal on Sunday, Walcott and Bendtner back 
 Big call by Wenger putting Arshavin in same bracket as Messi & Ronaldo. Says Arshavin can be all time gr8.
www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
#Arsenal 
Fabregas got my first ever 10/10 rating. Amazing display for #Arsenal. But why on earth do so many people leave so early? Stay and applaud!
 Easy for #Arsenal, 2-0 up after 18mins thru RvP and Diaby. Song great ball for first, Diaby finally wakes up for second. #Birmingham poor 
 Easy for #Arsenal, 2-0 up after 18mins. RvP with first, Diaby with second. Song set up first with great ball, even Diaby in mood! Brum poor 
 Walcott limps off after 32mins, following early clattering by Ridgewell. Arshavin on for #Arsenal. Walcott getting no luck with injuries 
 #Arsenal have taken foot off gas, could be edgy last 15mins as #Birmingham have brought on McSheffrey and O'Connor. Still 2-1 
Arshavin makes it 3-1 to #Arsenal. They've made meal of it but the Russian is a genius
Top quality gesture by #Arsenal fans - inc RedAction - to hold up number 4s in support of Cesc on Sat after his grandad's illness. Well done
 Flying out to Holland with #Arsenal today. Latest team news just afta lunch. Then Amsterdam tonight, Alkmaar tomorrow. Hope Wenger on form.. 
Bad news for Theo Walcott and #Arsenal. Our for up to three weeks with knee injury. Could miss #England too. Told he doesn't blame Ridgewell
Rosicky also missing for #Arsenal in Alkmaar. Should be back for weekend. Walcott ruled out for up to 4 weeks - & out of England - by Wenger
Read Wenger's views on #Arsenal and his future at www.mirrorfootball.co.uk later and in tomorrow's Mirror. Now for Amsterdam...
 Bit surprised Wenger kept faith Mannone for #Arsenal. Almunia hasn't been gr8 this season, but Mannone is a worry. Hope he comes thru 2nite 
 #Arsenal deserve to be 1-0 up, sloppy at times, but Fabregas's goal was sheer quality. Arshavin is brilliant to watch. A genius. 
 Wenger unhappy with #Arsenal's defending after conceding last gasp leveller to AZ Alkmaar.1-1. Straight home, then Talksport breakfast show! 
 Shame a wonderful Total Football goal from Fabregas didn't end in #Arsenal win. Arshavin was brilliant. Flying home with team,they are down. 
How will Wenger spend his 60th birthday? He didn't fly back with the #Arsenal team as he went off to watch another game on Weds. Continued..
 Cont... Wakes up alone, then flies back to AGM and then Europa League on TV in the evening... It's all glamour for #Arsenal boss. Legend. 
 #Arsenal AGM. Hill-Wood's bizarre display, AW hero reception, Gunnersaurus' Jersey link, Silent Stan stays silent 
 More later on #Arsenal AGM. V strange questions, odd issues and, oh yes, the chairman. Wenger's a hero again tho 
 You gotta love #Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood. Old school. Mind u, you're not going to love him if you're a Spurs fan and see the papers 
Most bizarre question of the #Arsenal AGM? Why is there a need for sprinklers? The Dutch and Brazilians don't need a greasy surface. Oh dear
 #Arsenal AGM. Closely followed by... Does Gunnersaurus go on tour? Hill-Wood: I'm told he was in Chernobyl, you remember that nuclear place 
Surreal stuff from the #Arsenal AGM. Very odd questions. So next time you have a go at journalists for not asking the right things...!
Another interesting thing from #Arsenal AGM - Wenger's fierce defence of his keepers. He's happy with keepers and doesn't need to buy. Mmm..
 At #Arsenal press conference - so check back for team news. Then #Arsenal TV Online later, live from 8.15pm with Tom Watt and Charlie George 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger in good mood at presser. Mixed injury news: Rosicky out, Bendtner faces test, Eduardo returns. Weng praises Zola 
Don't miss #Arsenal TV tonight. On Fans Forum live from 8.15pm.
Off to #WestHam v #Arsenal shortly. Gonna take in #Liverpool v #ManUnited. Draw at Anfield. Difficult away win at Upton Park.
#WestHam fought and deserve credit. #Arsenal collapsed. Why on earth did Wenger stick with Mannone?! When will he buy a top keeper? Too late
Easy street for #Tottenham as they beat #Everton 2-0. Bentley man of match for #Spurs. A year ago since his wonder goal at #Arsenal
 So who is #Arsenal's number one? 
Almunia, Fabianski, Mannone or Szczesny. Almunia may have lost his no1 status
Off to #Arsenal v #Liverpool. Think Liverpool may sneak it. And why? Arsenal are going to play slightly stronger team! The kids are great!
 #Spurs striker Robbie Keane says #Tottenham on a par with #Arsenal - and can overtake. Is he right or wrong?
www.mirrorfootball.co.uk 
 Which former #Arsenal star has begged to go back to the club? 
Read my online column on Thursday...
www.mirrorfootball.co.uk 
Reckon Almunia back for Sat. And an old adversary whipping up things before then... Promises to be a cracker: #Arsenal v #Spurs
Fair to say Wenger doesn't agree with Robbie Keane that #Spurs are on a par with #Arsenal. Noticeable Wenger didn't exactly praise Harry...
 Wenger admitted:   I am always tempted to recall Almunia.   Looks like Manuel has waited long enough to return for #Arsenal 
Manuel Almunia is back in goal for #Arsenal v #Spurs. Time for experience and Almunia is better than Vito. Still think it'll be a draw tho
Manuel Almunia back for #Arsenal. U read it here first yesterday and in Mirror Sport
#Arsenal away to Man City. Adebayor revenge! #Tottenham at #ManUnited. Blackburn v Chelsea and Portsmouth v Villa. Carling cup quarters
#Arsenal excellent. Van Persie was a thorn in Spurs' side all game. But Vermaelen was brilliant at back. Almunia comes back with clean sheet
Gr8 quote from Wenger as he lost his rag during #Arsenal win. 'I couldn't communicate with players because of noise. I'm not used to that!'
#Arsenal boss gives RvP highest praise yet... Can be best in PL. Also questions whether art of tackling is dead. Mirror Sport - web&paper
#Arsenal striker Robin van Persie wants to play in Carling Cup quarter final at #ManCity. Wonder why?!?!
 My match report on #Arsenal 3 #Tottenham 0 with full player ratings.

 #Arsenal striker Robin van Persie on revenge mission against #ManCity's pantomime villain Emmanuel Adebayor. 

Off to #Arsenal training and press conference tomorrow so will have some team news late morning and Champs League preview after lunch
Rosicky is back in training for #Arsenal. Pat Rice pulling Rosicky's leg that he's finally fit. Eboue smiling for the cameras!
Wenger just had long chat with Senderos at #Arsenal training. Interesting... Bendtner may need surgery on his groin and def out for 4 weeks
#Arsenal defender Gael Clichy facing lengthy lay off with stress fracture in his back. Major blow. Gibbs comes in
 Wenger relaxed about Kroenke's latest share purchase. As long as he does not interfere, the #Arsenal manager is ok with silent Stan 
Sky tried out their new 3D technology at #Arsenal reserves' defeat to Portsmouth on Monday night. Hope the 2 goals didn't look too bad in 3D
 Asked Diaby about his commitment at #Arsenal press con today. He looks so lazy and so many fans say it. He, of course, says he's committed 
Clichy is a terrific player for #Arsenal but wonder whether his back injury may explain indifferent form this season. Big chance for Gibbs
 Off to #Arsenal shortly. AZ Alkmaar looked poor a fortnight ago, Arsenal should cruise it. Plenty of lively Dutch fans in town. Should b gud 
This is easy for #Arsenal. Two goals for Cesc but Diaby has been outstanding and scored a goal reminiscent of Vieira. Diaby superb 4 change!
 My column... Player ratings: everyone from #Beckham, #ManUnited's #Owen, #Liverpool's Carragher, #Arsenal hate em

 Wenger unhappy with Atletico Madrid tapping up #Arsenal youngster Fran Merida. Contract been on table for 3 months, Merida aint signed yet.. 
 Wenger very relaxed about latest Kroenke share buy up at #Arsenal. Wenger's da man and Silent Stan knows it. Board like Kroenke, AW happy 
In tomorrow's Mirror and on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk Wenger assesses #Arsenal's strike force and see whether he'd swap anyone for RvP
 @Jerm_C You're right - good player. To be fair, would u sign if you weren't in #Arsenal first team? But Atletico seem determined. 
 #Liverpool striker Torres saw same Spanish doc, Ramon Cugat, who treated #Arsenal captain Fabregas last season. Guardian says 3 week lay off 
 Mind u, #Arsenal captain Fabregas came back early and other sites suggesting #Liverpool's Torres could play Monday. What will the doc say!? 
 Guess how many brothers and sisters #Arsenal's Alex Song has... His improvement, African Nations Cup, trophies...

 #Cardiff's former #Arsenal striker Jay Bothroyd on Heskey, derby day, biggest mistake of his life, facing Maldini

 Big test for #Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey, in for Song. Sagna in for Eboue, Eduardo in for Nasri. Risky strategy from Wenger on the road 
Stan Collymore questioning #ManCity pair Lescott and Toure on Talksport. U don't get much for £37m these days. #Arsenal gr8 business on Kolo
#Arsenal 2-0 up. Whenever u question genius of Wenger... he proves u wrong! OG and Eduardo. Surely moving up to second...
Told #Arsenal full back Gibbs would've got full #England call for #Brazil had u-21s not had competitive game. Gibbs in Capello's WC thoughts
#Arsenal have sent a strong message with demolition of Wolves. Fantastic win. But can they maintain that level and consistency all season?
#ManCity fans on phone-ins about after their slump. Why worry? U have ex-#Arsenal striker Adebayor to rally dressing room! Man for a crisis!
 #Arsenal striker Bendtner gets voted Danish player of year, wins goal of season (v Portugal) and will go under knife - longer lay off 
 Friend raised gr8 point.. If Rafa admits #Liverpool striker Ngog dived will he drop him? #Arsenal's Eduardo got caned, what will b reaction? 
#Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has never once mentioned Darren Fletcher in his moans this season. Some papers (not Mirror) put 2+2=5. Unfair
 @arseblog Screaming back page headlines today though... Cheat and King Con. Come on, we didn't ignore it. I haven't got anti Arsenal agenda 
 Bad news for injured #Arsenal striker Bendtner
He won #Denmark Goal & Player of Year last nite. V improved player 
 #Arsenal striker Bendtner: my targets for next 5 years. Brilliant to have a player with ambition. Like his style!
@garyprince All over #Arsenal fans' websites - and they slag off papers for running the Cesc for Barca stories! Incredible
 I really admire #Arsenal striker Bendtner's arrogance. Set your targets high - or fail. Well done, Nick.
 #Arsenal fans: I'm public enemy no1 for having a go at #Liverpool striker Ngog. They say I'm anti Rafa, just like u said I was anti Arsenal 
 Not anti-#Liverpool or anti-#Arsenal/Eduardo. Just anti-diving. Fans should be ashamed of their players cheating!
 @wrightsnake But hopefully you realise just because I think those incidents are wrong, I'm not anti-Arsenal. Thanks again 
 @StevieGooner Ta 4 your comments, Stevie. I'm not anti as u know & did u not read match reports v Wolves: all glowing. Hardly anti Arsenal! 
Out with #Arsenal legend Ray Parlour tonight. Promised to show me the sights - should be interesting...
 Plenty of #Arsenal stories, Ray Parlour is great company. Gilberto expected to start for #Brazil v #England. Dohar is bizarre place 
 Desperate news for #Arsenal on van Persie. Long injury lay-off. May expose gaps in squad, esp with Bendtner out too 
 #Arsenal striker Van Persie update: no break, ligaments partially ruptured. May be closer to 2 months than 3 but he's not a quick healer 
Brilliant trip though. #Arsenal legend Ray Parlour in top form - what a great bloke. Shame about the game! Not much learnt by Capello either
 #Arsenal say 6 weeks for RvP to return, but he's not a quick healer. He's determined to get back quickly - he'll do anything to return asap 
 Bordeaux won't wanna sell Chamakh to #Arsenal in January. Free nxt summer. We know what Wenger is like - he hates panic buys, forget it 
 Spent quality & entertaining time with #Arsenal chief exec Ivan Gazidis 2nite. Arsenal fans: yr club is in safe, ambitious and v good hands 
 #Arsenal striker Robin van Persie believes this can speed up his recovery - with his club's blessing!
Finally good news for #Arsenal! Kieran Gibbs hasn't suffered fracture just severe bruising on his foot. Out for 2 weeks rather than 2 months
 Silvestre may be option or Traore, or Sagna at left back, Eboue right back for next few #Arsenal games. Gotta hope Gibbs back for Chelsea 
Good news also that #Arsenal striker Eduardo signs on for next few seasons. Let's hope he gets fit and back to his best
Am told #Arsenal striker RvP's treatment going well in Serbia - even it it turns my stomach! Still doubt he'll be back inside two months
Ex #Arsenal striker Thierry Henry practically picked the ball up. Talk about Hand of God! Gallas puts France on way to World Cup. Disgrace
#Arsenal legend Thierry Henry has gone from sporting hero and football genius to cheat in an instant. He knew what he was doing. So poor
 Staggered that #Arsenal fans defending Henry, saying anyone would do it, he's been wronged in past. Astonishing. 2 wrongs don't make a right 
@Aphiss So bear that in mind next time Arsenal are cheated! U can't have any complaints
Gutted. And gutted people are defending such an outrageous piece of cheating. #Arsenal fans can never complain they've been cheated again...
 @randomanomaly doesn't make it right. With that argument, don't complain next time player dives against arsenal as eboue did it at OT and CL 
 @arseblog Gutted. Heroes ain't supposed to do that. Ruins it for me. Next time Arsenal are cheated, no one can complain. This was a big game 
@arseblog Are u serious?! If nothing to do with Arsenal why did I get so many texts? He's an Arse ledge partly for his sportsmanship. Poor
@DJTayo Remind u of that next time arsenal are cheated. Real talk
@arseblog since when am I slagging off Arsenal? Paranoia city. I'm slagging off an Arsenal legend. Memories ruined.
@OleGunner Why do u think im victimising arsenal? Im just so disappointed in an arsenal hero
 @YouAreMyArsenal Maybe you're right, just so gutted for Ireland in a way that I'd be gutted if someone did that to Arsenal 
@Daz_R And ta for your patronizing wishes. Do u still not regard him as Arsenal hero? I'm v disappointed in a ledge. Do u understand that?
 @Orbinho Couldn't agree more. And I wasn't meaning every Arsenal fan, I assure you. Many came back and agreed. 
 @arseholic Ha, ha. Magic. Why are you so paranoid? Do some research. Not having a go at Arsenal, u wally. Having a go at an Arsenal legend 
 @StevieGooner I can't remember Stevie the point u were making last week, pls remind me. By the way, not having a go at Arsenal in slightest 
 @Clarkey101 Hello Clarkey 101. Let me ask u a question: how old are you? I'm not having a go at Arsenal, I'm having a go at an Arsenal ledge 
 @QueenofSuburbia I agree with u 100pc. I'm not having a go at Arsenal, having a go at AFC ledge. AFC fans defended TH and I just responded 
Let me get this straight. Not knocking Arsenal. I am criticising an Arsenal legend. He broke my heart with his cheating. Then Arsenal tbc...
@Clarkey101 I was going to Arsenal games b4 u were born. Your paranoia is so childish. AFC fans defending him r wrong. Agreed? Hate cheats!
 @YouAreMyArsenal Yup, agree. 100 per cent. See? Not having a go at Arsenal, honest. Just an Arsenal ledge. Disappointed in him 
 @arseholic No. Many agreed. Have the tweets to prove it. They're not just as blinkered as u. Not being anti Arsenal at all, just anti Henry 
 @arseholic Well, if it's irrelevant - don't read it then! And now you're swearing... Sad. I promise u I'm not anti Arsenal. Check that out 
@arseholic I said those fans who condone cheating can't complain next time. Not all Arsenal fans. Not Arsenal as a collective. Pls check up
@Daz_R I've lost a lot of respect for a lot of Arsenal fans. Do u condone cheating? Most don't and I respect them a lot.
 Thanks to vast majority of fair minded #Arsenal fans for yr support. Not anti-Arsenal, just ant-cheating. Just wish AFC ledge hadn't cheated 
 @ninthart Trust me, you're barking up the wrong tree if u think I'm anti Arsenal or that Arsenal are in some way to blame 
 @ninthart Oh, gosh. Once again... Was saying he was an Arsenal hero of mine and that's why it made me so angry 
 I am gutted for Ireland, gutted. He was an Arsenal God. For me, up there with Paul Davis! But TH as a sporting hero has been damaged by this 
 @arseblog And your Arsenal thing... To me, he's still Arsenal, and was up until last night an Arsenal legend. That's the AFC connection 
 Sorry, but gotta run and do the day job. Please remember: not being anti-Arsenal, just anti Henry for what he did and anti cheating. Bye 
 #Arsenal legend Ian Wright on Henry.   He’s fondled it. If that was a woman he could have got arrested. His hand does a little flick   
@Aphiss Dont criticize Arsenal fans!
I'm looking forward to tomorrow - back to normal service and #Arsenal press conference ahead of Sunderland. Injury/news update at lunchtime
 @arsenalopinion I have paper in front of me and it says Barcelona's former Arsenal striker. Sadly, it also has wrong by line on it... 
 @arseblog What do u mean ffs? Aren't u forgetting he cheated? Pls reflect mood of nation. And why r u bothered? After all, no longer Arsenal 
@arsenalopinion Hooray! Glad to hear it. Mate - have 2 say our place is joke with mistakes. In paper it's Barcelona's former Arsenal striker
 #Arsenal Wenger says France 'embarrassed' by WC storm, game should be replayed and video evidence used. Vela, Eduardo, Denilson in squad 
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Walcott back in squad for Sunderland with Vela and Eduardo competing for striking role. Surely Ed?!
 Wenger also says RvP making good progress - but #Arsenal boss doesn't approve of placenta treatment. Quite right, sounds immoral to me 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says he is   proud   the way French public have reacted and said they're not happy with WC qualification 
 I did ask #Arsenal boss Wenger whether England would be as sporting as the French. He's too much of a gent to answer! Wot a great, great man 
 @Jhomsie How wonderfully patronising, thanks. He plays for Barca but was still an Arsenal legend till Weds nite. Tricky to understand... 
#Arsenal boss Wenger hinted yesterday Arshavin is tired and may be rested - let's hope he's fresh as a daisy. Great player and so important
 Bad day for #Arsenal, gr8 day for #Chelsea. Arsenal really need to win next Sunday to stop Chelsea running away. Such a big game now. 
 @simonbirdmirror Listened to #Arsenal on 5Live, they said Ramsey subbed was mistake, Rosicky hammered for not clearing. AA23 shoulda started 
#Arsenal boss Wenger must unleash Walcott asap. Theo can lift team and they've spoken about playing him thru middle in nxt game or two
Horse placenta? More like horse manure! Lay off a desperate blow for RvP. #Arsenal boss Wenger should buy in Jan to give team a boost
On Talksport tonight from 8pm to 10pm. Sure #Arsenal will crop up in conversation...
Come on #Adebayor time to show some humility and appreciate what #Arsenal and Wenger did for you. Made your career that's what.
 Be good to see Jack Wilshere for #Arsenal tonight. Celtic want him on loan in Jan. If he goes out on loan, he needs test in English football 
I'm worried about #Arsenal's Arshavin latest outburst. Sounds unhappy. But what about him taking some responsibility? Where was he on Sun?!
 Silvestre has started well for #Arsenal, Song strong too. Need Rosicky to run midfield tonight. Arsenal doing Ok, keeping A&$@;yor quiet 
Want Merida to be doing more. If he's got an #Arsenal future then he needs to show summat tonight
 #Arsenal simply have to take Traore off, getting exposed (no protection mind), on a yellow, and looks weak link. AFC ok generally. 0-0 h/t 
 Jamie Redknapp slaughtering Ade@$yor, criticising his attitude and desire. #Arsenal boss Wenger and Hughes exchanging words on touchline... 
Ade&$8or playing - or not - like he did at Old Trafford for #Arsenal in Champs League last season
Rosicky - that was pathetic. Show some spirit. #Arsenal made it easy for Tevez. 1-0 City. Senior player let kids down
 That's it for #Arsenal. I understand what Wenger does with this cup, but he's gotta win a trophy asap. Bad night for Wenger and Arsenal 
TV pundits talking about #Arsenal needing more experienced players tonight. Great irony is that Rosicky is senior player and was villain
 Forget kids and Carling Cup. Bad defeat, another trophy gone. If #Arsenal can't compete for title, maybe AW should try and win this instead 
 Stop treating #Arsenal cash like your own, Mr Wenger. Got 22m for Ade so why didn't AFC spend 6m on chamakh?New players needed, thin squad 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger was out of order not to shake Hughes' hand. Whatever u think, take moral high ground and be sporting. Disappointing 
 Even Alan Smith says #Arsenal fans may be losing patience in Wenger dismissing Carling Cup. Arsenal need a trophy, long way home after loss 
@behnisch Arsenal can do both!
 @arsenalmania If they'd gone extra 1m think they woulda got him after the posturing. Arsenal sold EA&KT for 37, charge fans big bucks, but.. 
 Disappointing that #Arsenal Wenger didn't shake Hughes' hand. Even if City showed disrespect, gain upper hand with handshake. Poor example 
 @littlemsgooner Goodnight. Don't worry, they'll be up for Sat, fancy #Arsenal to bounce back strongly 
 #Arsenal went for Edin Dzeko in summer, were quoted fortunes & Wolfsburg (funded by VW) didn't wanna sell. Gr8 player, fear he's outta reach 
 #Arsenal coach Bora Primovic watched Dzeko lots and recommended him, but Milan were quoted £30m! German player of year, not cheap 
#Arsenal boss Wenger hates to pay OTT. AW likes Lille starlet Eden Hazard and Toulouse's Andre-Pierre Gignac. Wont pay over odds for Chamakh
 @asha_man What's a bot? Has been known, but Arsenal in my sights at mo 
 @asha_man Well, ta v much. Just do cover a lot of Arsenal, but at Arsenal v Stoke Sat so will go 50-50 with Stoke. Pulis: my manager of year 
 @andrew14ad Totally agree, Andrew. But what grates is Arsenal banked over odds for KT & EA, also charge high prices - and yet hate spending 
 Shocked at level of flak #Arsenal boss Wenger is getting. Should have shaken hands, but is unquestionably still the right man for the job 
 @arsenalbilly Yes, he rarely surprises us. But this time he needs to. Arsenal don't need another season ending like last 
 Few players need big performances for #Arsenal on Sat. Sagna been poor this season, Arshavin needs to show. That's bigger prob than injuries 
Off to #Arsenal vs #Stoke shortly and back to work. Had enough of WC draw now. Club football and my team every time! Love it.
Gr8 save from #Stoke keeper Sorensen to deny #Arsenal capt Fabregas from pen spot. Arsenal lost Eduardo inj in training so relying on AA23
#Arsenal boss Wenger got great reception from fans before k/o. Great to see. Will need support as #Stoke up for it. Great goal by AA23. 1-0
#Arsenal keeper Almunia struggling under #Stoke aerial bombardment. Ref Clattenburg just given a f/k in AFC favour. No foul whatsoever
 Arshavin really putting in a shift for #Arsenal today. Exceptionally greedy, but won a pen (missed) and scored. Still 1-0, 41mins gone 
 Ramsey on for Eboue, 54. Vela on for Rosicky at h/t. #Arsenal fans quiet, #Stoke fans mocking them. Now they've come alive again. Still 1-0 
Big gaps in stands at #Arsenal today. Cannot believe people buy tickets and don't come or at least give the season ticket to a mate
#Arsenal 2-0 up Ramsey 79. Great run from a vastly improving and developing. Came at a crucial time just when #Stoke were threatening
 Bad injury news for #Arsenal. Rosicky out again, Young team going to Olympiakos gets even younger! Eboue, Traore also inj after limping off 
 Freddie Ljungberg was at #Arsenal v Stoke. Read Arsene Wenger on whether there's any chance of a return later...
www.mirrorfootball.co.uk 
@littlemsgooner I agree with u to a point. Not anti Arsenal tho. Maybe favoured towards English at times. But look at Diouf 4 example. TBC
@littlemsgooner He's hardly given an easy ride. Not anti Arsenal. Look at all the praise in media for great football. People forget that
I asked #Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger about those RvN rumours. Is he interested? V amusing answer. In Mirror tomorrow and website later...
 Will be a really young #Arsenal team against #Olympiacos. Big test for Wilshire and Merida. Sadly, Matt Derbyshire out inj for O. Admire him 
 #Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has looked down in past two weeks - but the RvN question really made him laugh. A great boss, top bloke too 
Theo Walcott set to start for #Arsenal at Olympiacos Gonna be v young team - even compared to #ManUnited at Wolfsburg. Big guns stay at home
Off to Athens today with #Arsenal. Will do news and injury updates. Gonna be very young squad.
 #Arsenal squad for Olympiacos: ten teenagers, youngest ever, theo in and silvestre to be captain 
#Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger on his Euro kids: 'it is a risk because if we lose we will be criticised. But I trust these players.'
 #Arsenal squad and Wenger on kids for Olympiacos game now on Mirror website
www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
Full preview later and in Weds paper 
 Think this will be #Arsenal team: 4-1-4-1: Fabianski; Gilbert, Bartley, Silvestre, Cruise; Song; Walcott, Wilshere, Ramsey, Merida; Vela. 
#Arsenal boss Wenger hinted heavily he may let Wilshere go out on loan in Jan. Wenger full of praise for Olympiacos boss Zico. Sivestre capt
 In stadium for Olympiacos v #Arsenal. Team as predicted, big nite for Walcott and Wilshire. Just 6 on bench, prob with Thomas CL eligibility 
 #Arsenal goalless at h/t after dull opening 45. Walcott trying hard, had best chance. Ramsey getting better with each game, he's been good 
Defeat for #Arsenal but spirited performance earns praise from Wenger. Ramsey outstanding. Walcott OK after late knock. Vela v disappointing
 @PaulCULLIFORD Not sure it will at Arsenal. Super talent, but English football may not suit 
 Can I make it clear: Don't want a change in #Arsenal manager, maybe just philosophy. Wenger still king
My column:
Wasn't at #Arsenal v #Spurs 4-4 either. Was preparing to do my bit for charidee - New York Marathon. Doing London in April for 3rd time...
#Arsenal striker Vela latest player to sign long term deal. Negotiations must have been done before Olympiacos game! Needs to improve
#Arsenal striker Bendtner out until New Year. That will turn up heat on Wenger to buy in Jan. Arshavin should be OK for Liverpool. Eboue out
 #Arsenal boss Wenger must rate Vela highly, deal is until 2015, that's a whopping six years. Plenty of time to improve and Wenger gr8 judge 
 Wenger says #Arsenal want injury plagued Tomas Rosicky to sign new deal, says Sol can still play at top, Diaby could be back for Liverpool 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger said:   I love Sol   after being asked whether he'd sign Campbell. But u could tell from his manner it aint a go-er 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger spoke 2day about title race, Jan transfer window and Cesc story More on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk later and in Sat paper 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger tore into his players at h/t, according to Cesc. 'Not fit to wear shirt' jibe by AW inspired remarkable 2nd half win 
Last season Arshavin scored four... this time just one. But what a goal! incredble. Puts Arsenal right back in it and Rafa in big trouble
 Off to #Arsenal press conference on Tues for team news etc ahead of Burnley. Beat Liverpool, lose to Burnley?! Typical. Afternoon updates 
 To make that amazing win count, #Arsenal gotta win the next one. For me, questions have to be raised about Almunia, in poor form. 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says most open title race in history, 8 teams could win. Denilson, Traore out. Silvestre will play l/b at #Burnley. 
#Arsenal boss Wenger also ruled out any possibility of Cesc playing for Catalunya. As he did last Friday...
 #Arsenal boss Wenger said Silvestre will start at #Burnley, he will stick with Almunia too. Wenger paid tribute to   exceptional   Arshavin 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger glowing about Arshavin, revealing about his d/room outburst. Read on mirrorfootball website later and paper tomorrow 
#Arsenal boss Wenger likes and rates Silvestre. Read in paper 2morrow and on website later about Silvestre's Arsenal future. He def has one!
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Arsenal's new hardman... Andrey #Arshavin! This guy has got true grit and spirit.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger: management is like a   volcano   and find out what other insult he said at h/time at Anfield.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger is desperate for which defender to stay - but fears he may lose him. You'll be surprised!
 Find out which players are in my Premier League XI of decade. #Chelsea, #ManUnited and #Arsenal players in there
Saw pen against #Arsenal - very dubious. Wenger makes good points but shame didn't come after win as will now be dubbed bad loser (draw-er)
#Wolves boss McCarthy has stirred up a hornet's nest. Agree 100pc with #Arsenal boss Wenger. Fielding reserves brought league into disrepute
 #Arsenal boss Wenger not quite so convincing in his Hull week off argument, but majority of #Wolves fans slaughtering Mick McCarthy 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says the Gunners have a   50-50 chance   of beating #Porto in the #ChampionsLeague draw.   It's a very difficult draw.   
Denilson returns for #Arsenal v #Hull but Cesc Fabregas could miss #AstonVilla game on Dec 27. Weng confirms #Burnley want Wilshere on loan
 #Arsenal boss Wenger in great form today. Wenger philosophy 1 on finance: If we make £1, we don't spend £2. So no signings in Jan then! 
 #Arsenal boss philosophy on debate:   I am not scared to give a different opinion. I give my opinion. Others don't want the aggravation.   
I'm on #Arsenal TV Online tonight. Fans Forum show 8.15pm to 10pm with Shovel and Dan Roebuck. Go on... Gimme a call - but be nice!
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on #Hull, Phil Brown, Fabregas' choice of clothing and why it's such an important game. On website later, paper 2morrow 
@DJTayo I actually have one. But I'm not Arsenal capt and representing club. Be looking out for u 2morrow. I'll be wearing pink carnation
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on the Champs League draw
www.mirrorfootball.co.uk later and Sat paper for more Arsenal news 
Off to #Arsenal v #Hull. Arsenal have to make run of home games count. Not sure whether Wenger realises how nervy fans are about Almunia
 #Arsenal keeper Almunia restored confidence today, 2 great saves. Diaby outstanding. Eduardo disappoiting, Silvestre good. Ref Bennet awful 
 What does signing players like Adebayor get u? The sack. Any #Arsenal fan could tell u about his attitude. Sympathy, but players let MH down 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger had his rows with #ManCity boss Hughes down the years, but was quick to offer his sympathy. Weng is class act 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger wished new #ManCity boss Roberto #Mancini well. Compared MC to F1 car, needing to go quick but plenty of money to spend 
 MotD pundits have rubbished the #Hull penalty against #Arsenal defender Silvestre. Ref Bennett was very poor, should be off list nxt week 
 Big games, big games coming up for #Villa. Tests ahead against Arsenal and Liverpool 
@dreamfight3r I really appreciate that. Please spare a thought for me as someone else accused me of being anti Arsenal! Astonishing
 @jimwise Many thanks, can u believe someone else said I'm anti Arsenal! Amazing 
@jamesr180 Have a look elsewhere on Mirror website at my piece covering Arsenal for a decade. See if I'm anti Arsenal! U doughnut
@GeezyPeas Thank u so much. Now pls tell a few wallies out there I'm not anti Arsenal!
 In case you missed it... Here's my decade covering Arsenal:
U may see how much respect I have for Wenger... TBC 
 Then again, according to jamesr180, I'm anti Arsenal and xenophobic. Er, right... 
#Arsenal get major boost after Nasri gets Bennett let-off. Ref reviewed video and didn't believe it was worth a charge. Available for Villa
 #Arsenal boss Wenger under pressure to buy in Jan - and not just from fans...
I think he'll get a striker... 
 #Arsenal and #Hull charged with failure to control players after Emirates fracas. Hull recently fined £7,500 for same offence. No biggie 
 Here's my view on why #Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger should spend in Jan - cos he's good at it - and who he wants
Back at football on Sun: #Arsenal v #AstonVilla. Cesc huge for Arsenal. Wenger loves Agbonlahor: one of his dream players. Should be cracker
Sensational win for #Arsenal. Wenger fears Fabregas lay off may force him into market for midfielder. Great performance by Diaby though
 #Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger on why he'd take the same Cesc gamble again...
 Despite Cesc's great performance, we shouldn't forget #Arsenal's Abou Diaby's brilliant display. Read my report:
Good news for #Arsenal with Cesc out of #Portsmouth. #Cameroon allow Alex Song to report up for ANC after West Ham cup tie. Eboue gone now
#Arsenal boss Wenger convinced that #Chelsea will carry on dropping on points in title race. Injury-hit Arsenal will be short at #Portsmouth
#Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas had scan today. No quick return but doesn't seem as if it's going to be a long lay-off. Needs a rest though
 #Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas pledges future to the club - and hopes to make quick return.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger admits admiration for #ManCity striker Craig Bellamy - but fears they won't sell him.
 #Arsenal boss on why #Chelsea will keep slipping up, Prem Lge, Portsmouth and his two rocks - Diaby & Vermaelen
 #Arsenal winger Theo Walcott out with a side injury, Craig Eastmond in squad for #Portsmouth game 
#Arsenal: Almunia Sagna Gallas Vermaelen Traore Song Ramsey Diaby Arshavin Nasri Eduardo Subs Fab Rosicky Vela Silv Wilshere Merida Eastmond
#Portsmouth have made a fight of it recently. James Belhadj and Dindan up for sale in Jan cull. But they'll make it hard for #Arsenal
 Pitch looks OK down at #Portsmouth, not as cold as I thought it would be, but still gonna be tricky for #Arsenal. AFC fans in good voice 
#Arsenal saying it's only a minor setback for Theo but Walcott has to get himself fully fit asap to stop his season ending in frustration
#Portsmouth have not beaten #Arsenal since Perry Como topped the music charts with Magic Moments in March 1958
 Got to be honest, I'm not too bothered by lack of English thing for #Arsenal or #Portsmouth. One world, one love, all together. That's me 
#Portsmouth's cut backs means they'v only got one CD - 4th time we've had Florence & Machine: You Got The love b4 #Arsenal game. Gr8 track
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Cesc #Fabregas will be out for ten days. Back after the Everton game, I reckon. Shouldn't be rushed back again 
 Good early chance for out-of-form #Arsenal striker Eduardo but he glanced wide from Sagna cross. Eduardo in wretched form, lacks confidence 
 #Arsenal in charge and playing OK, but Eduardo has been out of sorts again and Ramsey needs to assert himself in midfield 
Maybe that's the stroke of luck #'Arsenal striker Eduardo needed! Heavily defelcted Edurado f/kick off Kaboul & Arsenal 1-0 up and deserved
#Arsenal on easy street now. They're not at their best and don't need to be. Nasri makes it 2-0 and Arsenal finding their rhythm.
#Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey scores cracking goal. He's been quiet at times - but took that brilliantly
 #Arsenal boss Wenger praised his midfield trio of Ramsey, Song and Diaby for the way they stood up to the physical battle at #Portsmouth 
 @arsenalopinion still think Chelsea  will do it, if I'm honest. Would like to be wrong. Imagine how good Arsenal would be with a striker! 
 Please read my match report: Portsmouth 1 Arsenal 4. Plus ratings - Diaby and Ramsey excellent
 Please read my match report: #Portsmouth 1 #Arsenal 4. Plus ratings - Diaby and Ramsey excellent 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger did great business selling Toure to #mancity - now Wenger must buy to win title. my column:
Let's hope signing a new contract heralds a new era of consistency for #Arsenal midfielder Abou Diaby. He's playing so well right now
#Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey was  19 on Boxing Day. I wrongly said 20. Sorry. He still had great game at Fratton Park. Happy New Year!
 #Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger will rest, rotate and revolve his team for the FA Cup tie at #WestHam. Arsenal could do with a trophy though... 
 #Aston Villa boss O'Neill defends Young against diving. #Arsenal fans: not just your players getting accused..
#Arsenal boss Wenger ready to play likes of Senderos Fabanski etc at #WestHam. Wenger though has won cup a few times... Bit risky though...
#Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey great example to Wilshere and Merida that it's not just about talent. It's about desire and commitment too
 #Arsenal midfielder Tomas Rosicky signs new deal - based on appearances, success etc 
 #Arsenal striker Bendtner returning soon, Wilshere targeting top loan move and Rosicky signs. All at: www.mirrorfootball.co.uk 
 PS. Senderos on way out of #Arsenal after not playing on Sun, a few clubs interested inc Everton and Bayern Munich. #ManCity chasing Vieira 
#Arsenal v close to getting Vieira last summer but concerns about his fitness remain. Good luck to him in reaching WC finals with any club
 Off to #Arsenal press conference at lunchtime ahead of #Bolton game. Team news, Wenger's views and possibly an interesting story or two.... 
I first reported on the Atletico Madrid tap-up row surrounding #Arsenal starlet Merida on Oct 15. No wonder he's not been playing well...
 #Arsenal team news ahead of #Bolton. Denilson back in squad, Fabregas not ready - out until Bolton away weekend after next at least. 
#Arsenal boss Wenger says #Vieira can be big success at #ManCity. Wenger clearly thinks he's going to Eastlands
Gael Clichy to return to training Mon. Wenger says he's in market and wants deals done early. AW says #Arsenal have 'hunger' to win title
 #Arsenal boss Wenger spoke about targets, Merida and Gallas. But that was in newspaper conference so embargoed till later. Keep u posted! 
#Arsenal confident at the mo that the #Bolton game will go ahead. Stay tuned... Perhaps more confident than chances of Merida of staying...
#Arsenal's Fran #Merida insists he hasn't signed a pre-contract with Atletico Madrid despite what his agent says Still fear he'll go in June
#Arsenal starlet #Merida may have more to say in tomorrow's programme. Hope he changes his mind. Hleb & Flamini: grass not always greener
 #Arsenal boss Wenger was in gr8 form: laughing at my scribbled note of transfer targets! More AW later on signings,Bendtner,Merida,titlerace 
I live fairly close to the #Arsenal... and there's a blanket of snow everywhere. Keep fingers crossed for tomorrow night...
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on fears for #Bendtner, #Merida, search for striker - Gignac no1 Plus Senderos & Sol return?
 #Arsenal boss Wenger fears Bendtner could be out for 2 months - if he is he will   absolutely   have to buy.
 #Arsenal boss #Wenger ahead of #Bolton has called it on with title rivals. 'Race starts now. We've got momentum.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger hails 'amazing' William Gallas. #Gallas set for talks on new contract. Maybe 1 year only...
 Heavy, heavy #snow in north #London now! Stay away from #Arsenal v #Bolton please! 
Done piece on #Arsenal striker targets for mirrorfootball.co.uk. On website in morning. Even showed my list to the great man - AW laughed!
 Here's #Arsenal striker shortlist - Wenger's even taken a look! #Gignac could be a go-er, doubts over #'Cole
 What a shame about the weather. Tube in London is chaos, central #London deserted because of #snow too. It's a real blow for #Arsenal. 
On #Talksport tonight after 7pm with #Arsenal legend Ray Parlour. Sure we'll be talking lots of Arsenal matters!
Think #Liverpool are going to snap Marouane #Chamakh on a pre-contract. May mean #Arsenal will buy big in Jan - no point in short term now
 @garyprince Thanks, Gary. Really appreciate it. Ray's top. Hopefully people will realise it's not anti-Arsenal! 
Plenty of agents knocking around #Arsenal in last few days... They're definitely trying to make things happen in January
 Don't be hasty Fran #merida - you may just regret leaving #Arsenal.
my column:
 I feel very honoured to be making my debut on Arseblog's Arsecast tomorrow. Really enjoyed it, lots of #Arsenal chat. Please listen in. 
 @DanCompton Yeah, I've seen it. I just think we all know what Arsenal's limits are... Sadly! 
 #Arsenal defender #Sol #Campbell set to turn back clock with Gunners...
Go to: www.mirrorfootball.co.uk 
 Could be shake up in #Arsenal defence if Senderos goes, he's desperate to leave for WC sake. Sol has been great in training by all accounts 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger rules out January move for Carlton Cole - too injury prone, he says. More news from press conference soon 
Many thanks for support everyone - so enjoyed the Arseblog Arsecast. Hope my #Arsenal views made sense... for a change!
#Arsenal boss Wenger confirms interest in Sol Campbell. 'We always have a level of interest in good players.' Bendtner poss back in 2 weeks
 #Arsenal boss Wenger also backs up Gazidis - Cesc Fabregas not for sale. Good stuff from AW More on Sol, Chamakh, strikers, PC brigade later 
#Arsenal boss Wenger positive on Bendtner - but says that may mean no new striker in Jan. 'Bendtner is doing well. It will influence us.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger also says Cesc is staying. 'We have a long-term plan to be a winning team, and Cesc #Fabregas is part of that.' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger on Vieira: 'He has made the right choice. City have made the right choice. It should be a good marriage.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger on why he didn't sign Vieira. 'I thought about bringing him back here but we had players like Song coming through.'
#Arsenal confident the #Everton game will be on. Up at the training ground now and there's hint of a thaw...
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Sol, Cesc, no to Carlton Cole, plus boost for Bendtner
On line now:
 Also, later on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk and in paper tomorrow.
#Arsenal boss praises Sol's attitude and talks about Chamakh, Gignac & Cesc 
 I live close to #Arsenal ground. I know #snow is forecast overnight - but I reckon #Everton game can, should and will go ahead. 
 Listening to #Vieira talk at #ManCity press conf, you understand why clubs want him even if he's on wane. A leader. Still #Arsenal legend 
 #Arsenal boss on Sol, Bendtner return, Cesc, Chamakh, Gignac, Cole. 
 Is it too late to call it off...? #Arsenal need to liven up, #Everton seem intent on revenge... 
 That's more like it for #Arsenal! Cruel for Everton's Osman - hero at one end, deflected in at other. 1-1 
 #Arsenal can be disappointed - but should be grateful for a point. Not good display, #Everton did well. Cesc can't come back quick enough 
 Daily Mail's Charlie Sale has broken good story on Danny Fiszman - could affect #Arsenal takeover.
 On #Talksport tonight after 8pm to discuss issues of the day - sure #Togo, #Arsenal and game at #ManCity will crop up! 
 Andrey Arshavin says #Arsenal need a 'miracle' to win title. In fairness, AA23 means with so many injuries...
Told you! #Arsenal get their Sol man
 #Arsenal defender Sol Campbell re-signs and set to play tonight! To those that doubted me... told ya!
I'm at Upton Park now for Sol #Campbell's return for #Arsenal. Updates later. Got team sheet and there it is: Sol's name at no6
Oh my God! Just seen #ManCity striker Emmanuel Adebayor on Sky Sports News wearing - and wait for it - an #Arsenal t-shirt!
#Arsenal defender Sol Campbell wins his first challenge of the night against #West Ham youngster Freddie Sears
 I've just posted a pic of Sol Campbell's return for #Arsenal!
 2-0 up,2 from Jay Thomas for #Arsenal, Sol Campbell looking rock solid and is leading the youngsters - inc partner Kyle Bartley - by example 
 Subbed at half time. 2-0 up, so easy night and return for Sol for #Arsenal 
 Sol Campbell looked good on his #Arsenal return, spoke well too and came through fine. All agreed, signing TBC asap. Will be great addition 
 #Arsenal swoop for Bolivian wonderkid. Samuel Galindo, 17, been on trial
 #Arsenal's old new boy Sol Campbell hails Arsene Wenger as an inspiration. Expect signing to be tied up asap
 #Arsenal outcast Senderos suffers anothers injury setback. Gallas also has back injury. That speeded up Sol deal
 #Arsenal potential signing of Bolivian wonderkid Samuel Galindo, 17, is one for the future rather than 'the one' in Jan. AW still looking... 
 #Liverpool believe they have shaken hands on Chamakh deal. #Arsenal boss Wenger was adamant they've not given up
 #Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner has been announced as ambassador of the Children Cancer Foundation of Denmark. Well done, Nick 
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas back for #Bolton game, Clichy close but Denilson out. Bendtner a fortnight away
 @dcreasey Last Friday, Wenger insisted that Arsenal were still in hunt for Chamakh - and they even rung him from Merseyside! 
AP's Rob Harris says Adebayor was wearing #Arsenal Tshirt as his luggage left on Togo team bus and his brother gave him shirt. Clears it up
 Sol Campbell will be great signing for #Arsenal. And lovely Ray Parlour anecdote. Romford Pele: legend
My column:
 Love Robbie Savage radio rant. Link to it here. Plus #Arsenal legend Thierry Henry used to do same...
My column:
 #Arsenal legend Sol Campbell ready to take leaf out of Maldini's book - and play till he's 40
 I wish I had never left #Arsenal in first place, admits Sol Campbell
 #Barcelona star Yaya Toure reveals #Arsenal regret - but still fancies Prem League
 #Arsenal outcast Senderos said on Mirror website on TUES he wanted to go. Won't be going quick - in surgical boot
 #Arsenal press conference tomorrow ahead of #Bolton game Sun. Team news (Denilson out), Wenger's views etc around lunchtime. Regular tweets 
 On #Arsenal TV Online on Friday night from 8.15pm, discussing all the goings-on at the Emirates. Please tune in - and call in! 
 #Arsenal outcast Senderos has foreign clubs in for him, inc Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, PS wants to stay in Prem. Everton not only club 
#Arsenal superfan Shovel and Tom Watt on Arsenal TV Online tonight. Wish me luck getting a word in... Those boys love it and are top men
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says there are   no major problems   stopping them signing Sol Campbell and says he will give   experience and advice.   
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Theo back in a fortnight, Clichy   minimum   of being on bench at Bolton and Cesc def back in squad 
#Arsenal boss Wenger rules out move for Racing Santander's Sergio Canales
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says no bad history with Bolton. 'Historically, we have struggled against any team when we've not played well.' 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger expects Sol to complete deal today, not ready for Sun but will be involved soon 
#Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey injured in training on Friday. He's doubt for #Bolton game with abdominal strain. Denilson has test on Sat
 #Arsenal boss Wenger hails 'more mature' Fabregas, Bolton double header, title race, confirms Bolivian signing
#Arsenal defender Sol Campbell completes his return to Gunners. Great signing. Wenger also said yesterday they've signed Galindo
 Without Ramsey and Denilson, #Arsenal very short of options in central midfield. Eastmond has done well in CC. Very inexperienced bench too 
 That should have been a penalty to #Arsenal, judging by the replay. Fabregas unlucky. Made decent start, Traore vulnerable 
Rosicky lucky not to be sent off. #Arsenal must show discipline in face of #Bolton provocation. Wenger may fall out with Coyle after this!
 This could be a huge win for #Arsenal, considering the injuries. Expect #Bolton to be better for Weds rematch as Coyle gets to grips 
Expect some mixed injury news from #Arsenal today... Better news for Denilson who should play Weds
 @darylbooth Oh, don't worry. People have said I'm a Stoke fan, Spurs, Chelsea, Arsenal Liverpool etc. Don't know why people obsessed! 
#Fenerbahce's out of favour #Turkey striker Colin Kazim Richards heading to Toulouse. Does this mean they're selling #Arsenal target Gignac?
 #Arsenal boss Wenger said Gignac was too pricey - mind u, said that about Arshavin! Personally, think chances of striker signing are fading 
 Think #Arsenal should sign a striker to boost title chances, really do. Theo could be back for #Bolton game. Denilson too 
 #Arsenal suffer yet another setback as Merida misses Weds with ankle injury, joining Ramsey and Nasri on injury list. Walcott & Denilson OK 
 #Arsenal should have Bendtner back after Stoke FA Cup tie. Wenger is going to have a look at why AFC getting so many, many injuries 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on the injury problems this season - and why he admits it is   strange.   Baffling more like!
Flamini looks on as #ManCity's #Arsenal old boy collection gathers pace. Shame City can't pay Arsenal wildly over the odds for him too...
 #Arsenal new boy Samuel Galindo passport is hoax. All documentation in order, I'm assured. He's 17. 
 Cesc Fabregas on his nightmare last season, his love for #Arsenal and Wenger's love of a song and a dance...
 Off to #Arsenal v #Bolton later. News, reaction and gossip when I get it... Looking forward to the game 
 As expected, #Arsenal back to full strength with Clichy in at left back 1 change for #Bolton: Mark Davies in for Klasnic who drops to bench 
 #Arsenal have started really badly, really flat. Poor defending for Cahill's opener for #Bolton. Wenger's men look tired, short of ideas 
#Arsenal beginning to find some rhythm. Great save from #Bolton keeper JJ to deny Fabregas. Bolton still 1up
Not what was supposed to have happened at #Arsenal. #Bolton 2 up Matt Taylor scores from spot after crazy Denilson foul. Can b no complaints
#Arsenal getting no luck. #Bolton's brilliant captain - I love him btw - Kevin Davies heads against his own bar. 0-. Bolton deserve this
Hope springs eternal!  Rosicky 1-2 for #Arsenal a screamer
#Arsenal winger Theo Walcott warming up...
#Arsenal on level terms! Fabregas Captain Fantastic! 2-2
 An absolute shocker of a challenge by #Arsenal's Gallas on Bolton's Mark Davies in build up to goal. Shoulda been a foul, MD stretchered off 
Comeback complete! Still time for another for #'Arsenal. Vermaelen strikes 3-2
 Oh no, another injury for #Arsenal. Incredible. Diaby hobbles off, looks bad. Eastmond coming on, 77 mins, Arsenal lead #Bolton 3-2 
 #Arsenal about to bring on Walcott, Bolton bringing on Klasnic. Both teams about to throw last, er, throw of the dice 
#Arsenal denied stone wall penalty whether the ball was going out or not. #Bolton keeper Jaaskelainen took Fabregas out.
#Arsenal top of the league! Arshavin scores! 85 mins
 6 minutes of added time! #Arsenal have got time for another, #Bolton look shot to bits 
 #Arsenal forward AA23 just shown unbelivable greed, going alone and missing when Theo was completely unmarked with goal at his mercy 
Outrage in press room about Gallas tackle on #Bolton's Davies. Diaby at Sunderland-esque. Interesting to c what #Arsenal boss Wenger says...
#Bolton boss Owen Coyle says it shoulda been a red card and suggested #Arsenal players should not have played on
 #Arsenal boss hails his comeback heroes, saying it would have been 'ludicrous' to think they could be top a few weeks back 
#Arsenal boss Wenger also apologises for Gallas tackle buts says wrong of Coyle to suggest they stop play. Good sportsmanship from AW
My match report centres on #Arsenal's amazing fightback - not just over course of 90 mins but also since being 11pts adrift at end of Nov
Captain Marvel Fabregas absolutely awesome again for #Arsenal. He's the driving force behind this team. They showed they are the real deal
But u gotta expect some stick for the Gallas tackle. If it was on #Arsenal player you'd be spewing! Wenger apologised which is good to see
 All in all, good night for #Arsenal. Only downside - injury for Diaby. Calf strain. Scan tomorrow and not looking good. Crazy injury list 
 My #Arsenal 4 #Bolton 2 match report is up now:
@elvpak Agreed. Though that being the case I shant bring up Spurs' goal at Arsenal April 06 which nearly prompted Wenger to hit Jol (joke!)
 @YankeeGunner I agree with u. Few players set out to 'do' an opponent, inc some of the worst offenders against Arsenal down the years 
 Why #Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas is my player of year so far & the arrogance of Barca and R Madrid. My column:
 #Dzeko had double training session at Wolfsburg yesterday, didn't finish till gone 6pm. Wasn't in #Arsenal lounge either. Sorry but unlikely 
 There may be a transfer on between #Arsenal and #Wolfsburg after all... 
 #Arsenal Sol Campbell a doubt for Sun at Stoke after neck inj in training. Diaby also may be 2-3 weeks. Sagna out
 @602gooner Well, certainly Arsenal haven't... 
#Arsenal press con Fri so come back at lunchtime for team news. Really hope Sol defies injury and makes it. News and injury inquest...
 As I said last week, still don't think that #Arsenal have given up on Chamakh for free in summer despite Liverpool. So maybe they'll wait... 
 Off to #Arsenal press conference today. Team news, Wenger speaks, get the first updates from lunchtime. Could be v odd line-up at Stoke... 
 #Arsenal press conference, boss Wenger says: If I didn't think we could win the league then, as manager, I should resign 
#Arsenal boss Wenger says there was 'over reaction' to foul on #Bolton's Mark Davies and it's 'good news' that he can play this weekend
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says that #Fulham's Smalling 'is a player we know, but it's not something we're looking at the moment.' 
 #Arsenal top of fair play league, that's best answer you can give, says Wenger when questioned more about Gallas' challenge 
I'm always amazed that when people say: the best way to beat #Arsenal is to kick them' says Wenger. 'And no-one says anything.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says 'unlikely' any signings in Jan. 'At the moment we are not on the verge of signing anyone.' Sorry, folks 
 More #Arsenal news about to go up on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
Wenger on a new striker, Bendtner and Smalling 
 Also by the way, don't think #Arsenal boss Wenger did miss training this week. Again, don't know where that came from... 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says it's   very unlikely   there will be a signing in Jan and talks about #Fulham's Smalling
 #Arsenal news up on mirror website later, but little taster: we're no soft touch, SSN rant, Gallas contract, team news: very, very young... 
 Mirror columnist on 3 nominations for Player of Year. #Arsenal's Fabregas, #ManCity's Given and #Chelsea's Anelka
 #Arsenal boss Wenger calls up kids for #Stoke tie. Coquelin, Thomas, Eastmond, Sunu, Wilshere, Bartley. AW says not certain Sol will play 
 Wenger on double standards on fouling, Sky Sports News rolling coverage, #Arsenal are no longer pushovers
 And I take #Arsenal boss Wenger's point when you see what #Stoke striker Fuller says...
 Furthermore, #Arsenal boss Wenger says he's opened talks with Gallas over new contract. Could be 2 yrs. Plus Senderos set for #Everton loan 
 Wenger fascinating on this. It's OK for teams to kick #Arsenal yet Gallas gets slaughtered. Ive tried to be fair:
 As I said last night, #Arsenal defender Senderos off to #Everton on loan. Good luck, Philippe. He's had lots of interest, but likes Prem Lge 
 As I reported a fortnight ago, #Arsenal ready to offer Gallas, 32, a 2 yr deal. At press con yesterday he said 'talks going well.' 
 #Arsenal defender Senderos joining #Everton on loan confirmed by Everton website. 
Remember you read #Arsenal's only signing so far (Campbell) and only departure so far (Senderos) here first...
 @PaulCULLIFORD Certainly ain't given up, Paul. Liverpool think they have shaken hands on it but Arsenal are still in there 
Sol Campbell set to start for #Arsenal at #Stoke after overcoming a neck injury. Big test for him. Theo in too and Thomas set for big chance
#Arsenal have got a bit of experience and the odd big gun lined up for #Stoke who will make it very tricky. Should be good cup tie
 #Arsenal boss Wenger has spoken already about couple of Sun paper rumours. He said not interested in Moses, likes Smalling but 1 for future 
 Carbon copy of #Arsenal's FA Cup tie at West Ham. Plenty of play, doing OK, but sloppy, poor passing and need to sharpen up. Sol doing well 
 Double deflection but they all count. Without playing well, #Arsenal are level thanks to Denilson. Still think Wenger will give rollicking 
 Seen it again on TV. Fair play, handball. Refs don't always give em in the box though! Agreed - big guns on by 70 if #Arsenal aren't winning 
 Sol for England, absolutely outstanding. Campbell has answered those who mocked Wenger and the notion of #Arsenal re-signing him 
 JET has done well for #Arsenal overall, got better. Poor Theo. Loved Wenger taking AA23's hat off - classic. Ramsey back - major boost. 
Credit to #Stoke. That was a terrific goal. #Arsenal will have to go for it now
 Another good goal, no long throw in sight either. #Stoke deserve credit. #Arsenal's mix+match team came up short, Weng must regroup for Weds 
#Arsenal boss Wenger must address goalkeeping problem. Fabianski poor and no successor to Almunia. Can't wait for Sczesny. New keeper a must
@1nil2thearsenal The same agent also said Mucha had a trial at Arsenal. He didn't. I don't know why these people say these things
#Arsenal keeper Vito Mannone signs new long term deal. Maybe they won't sign a new keeper after all... Thoughts?
 For all the #Arsenal bashing on Talksport & 606 for fielding weak FA Cup team, don't forget Cesc WANTED to play, he knows what it means 
#Everton confirm the signing of #Arsenal defender Senderos for the rest of the season. You read it here and in Mirror first!
Off to the #Arsenal press conference tomorrow ahead of #Villa game Weds night. Team news and views from lunchtime
 Sam Wallace in Indy says #ManUnited tracking #Fulham defender Smalling. Sam is excellent, it'll be good info. #Arsenal may struggle now... 
 Nasri, Bendtner, Sagna back for #Arsenal at #Villa. Song reports back on Weds, could be back for weekend 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Smalling, Wilshere out on loan, return of big 3 on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk shortly More later - inc Weng on keepers 
 Few clubs in for #Arsenal's Jack Wilshere. After #Portsmouth's ban lifted they're in hunt. Doubtful tho. Bolton, Burnley, West Ham Wigan too 
 My understanding that Smalling to #Manchester United is not done just yet. #Arsenal in there fighting. United have upper hand, but... 
 Later on mirrorfootball website, #Arsenal boss Wenger on the big four games ahead, the belief from winning at Liverpool & title chances 
 Also, one specially for my #Arsenal followers... Doing piece for mirror website on Wenger on keepers. V interesting comments. Check later 
@cool24 Thought I tweeted that United have upper hand and that Arsenal hoping for late twist Sorry for any confusion!Smalling is Arsenal fan
 One specially for a few #Arsenal followers on state of club's keepers. Read what Wenger said when I asked...
 We revealed former #Arsenal defender Senderos was joining #Everton. Find out why. Good luck to Philippe, top guy
 #ManUnited have edge over #Arsenal on #Smalling. But why was Smalling so deep in thought after #Spurs game?
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Sagna will be fit to start tonight, despite shoulder injury. Nasri, Bendtner on bench. Arsenal looking stronger... 
 Not confirmed but think Smalling gonna go to #ManUnited. Brave fight by #Arsenal, but he's gonna be one expensive and hot property 
Forget the verbals... The real blow for #Arsenal is injury to Vermaelen. Sol's up for it though - what a return for him. Will face ManUnited
 Does Arsene Wenger have a blind spot on #Arsenal keepers? My column:
 More #Arsenal news a bit later ahead of #ManUnited game, Wilshere set for #Bolton. Song due back by now - can't come quick enough 
At #Arsenal press conference tomorrow for team news ahead of #ManUnited game. Tune in a bit earlier...
#Arsenal boss Wenger says 'small but unlikely' chance for Vermaelen to play in Sun. Sol set to play if TV doesn't make it.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger praises Sol, says he can handle Roo. AW says he's 'sorry' to miss out on Smalling. 'Unlikely' they will make signing 
 #Arsenal board meeting later, that's why Wenger in a suit today for early presser, very dapper. Don't worry, normal monthly board meeting 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger is 'confident' his players can surprise him more than Man U players. Eduardo out, Bendtner may be 'short' to start 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Sol, Vermaelen, Smalling, Rooney, board meeting, transfers all on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk very shortly! 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger, looking smart ahead of board meeting, v good in his separate newspaper press conference. Read all about it 2morow! 
 Arsene Wenger on Vermaelen, Sol and Eduardo. His 'confidence' that #Arsenal can beat #ManUnited.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on it being 'unlikely' there will be any signings.
 Nah, not Arsenal - for change! Let u know asap. #Portsmouth cancelled Grant presser today by the way. But may be more exciting than that... 
 Lots of #Arsenal on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk and in Mirror Sport tomorrow. Arshavin exclusive, Wenger on Rooney plus old friend Chamakh 
 #Arsenal boss on Wayne Rooney - and THAT dive in 2004. And why Sol can stop Roo 
 #Arsenal keen for Chamakh boost and are also tracking Loic Remy. May struggle to get deals done now tho...
 Oh dear Martin O'Neill has another go at #Arsenal boss Wenger
 #Arsenal star Arshavin exclusive interview in today's Mirror. On politics, ballet, and parking in London! Oh yes, and Man United... 
#Arsenal boss Wenger gives his opinion because journos like me ask him. He is great. V childish by O'Neill. Wenger complimented Villa too!
 Sorry for lack of tweets. Very busy today with the day job. #Arsenal battered. Almunia awful, Denilson hopeless, need a centre forward. 
#Arsenal boss Wenger is rarely so harsh on his players. Wenger branded them 'naive' and said 'no cohesion.' Arsenal need a keeper!!!
 Sorry, but Wenger also said #Arsenal won't be making any late deals before 5pm Mon. Too late now anyway in truth. Deals have to be in place. 
 On the upside, did do an interview with a celebrity fan before the game for the #Arsenal magazine. Stringer Bell aka Idris Elba. Top man 
 I absolutely love The Wire, got Stringer Bell to sign my Homicide book by David Simon. He's a Londoner and #Arsenal fan 
 My match report on #Arsenal's devastating defeat to #ManUnited. Ratings in paper but Almunia, Nasri don't do well
 #Arsenal boss Wenger damning about his players. He's rarely this strong about them. Furious.
 Did say last week that I thought, having spoken to agents, that it'd be quiet. And so it is. #Arsenal will wait on Chamakh for summer. 
 Great result for #Hull. #Chelsea weak at back, no doubt. Think Chelsea will win title, but #ManUnited bang in it and #Arsenal have hope 
 #Arsenal striker Bendtner hoping to be back, raring to go for Sun. 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger, Stringer Bell, #WestHam and bit of #Chelsea capt #Terry (not a lot) in my column at www.mirrorfootball.co.uk tomorrow 
 #Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner desperate to make 'impact' on title challenge
 Two of my favourite people in my column today: #Arsenal boss Wenger and Stringer Bell. Don't be hasty on Wenger...
 #Arsenal set to complete deal for Brazilian wonderkid Wellington Silva - depending on work permit!
 #Arsenal boss Wenger gets tough with his players - ordered em in for extra training.
 #Arsenal press conf at lunchtime. Team news, Wenger's views on JT marriage guidance etc ahead of #Chelsea game. Will post things asap! 
 At #Arsenal training ground, press conference for #Chelsea game starting soon... 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Chelsea is   good opportunity to show   they are over United defeat. Says they have desire, ability & spirit to win 
#Arsenal boss Wenger insists they are still in 'very good position' in title race because every team will carry on dropping points
#Arsenal boss Wenger says he has enough problems of his own and that Capello is old enough to deal with John Terry
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says 'we should be more relaxed than we are now.' No-one expected us to be here, he says. 'We should not b intimidated' 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says they tried to make signing, refuses to say who or what position. On fans' frustrations: 'best way is to win games' 
#Arsenal forward Andrey Arshavin says the Gunners can't win the league with him playing up front. He admits he's too short...
 #Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri insists they can still win the title - but #Chelsea is last gasp saloon.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on frustration at lack of signing, THAT last gasp bid & my reading of who it may have been:
#Arsenal boss Wenger in good form today - not sure you'll like what he says tho. What's more important winning a trophy or finishing 3rd...?
#Arsenal boss Wenger and his views from our newspaper press conference at www.mirrorfootball.co.uk after 10.30pm tonight...
 Wenger also says who will be in goal for #Arsenal on Sunday at #Chelsea. Sorry, but it's all embargoed until bit later... 
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas says he'll return to Barcelona - but may be after he's retired. He says he loves London
#Arsenal boss Wenger says he'll stick with blunder keeper Almunia for #Chelsea. AW says Almunia not to blame last Sun. Mmmm...!
#Arsenal boss Wenger says finishing 3rd better than winning FACup. Qual from CL Group stages 10yrs consec 3xharder than winning 5 Lgue Cups!
#Arsenal boss Wenger's defence of his record and why cups not everything on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk shortly. Me off to bed - long day!
It was my question to #Arsenal boss Wenger whether finishing 3rd better than winning FA Cup cos it's good talking point.Wot do u all think?
U may not be surprised to learn I was pushing the Almunia question too! Think he should be dropped. Also think #Arsenal should call up Theo
I'm with Wenger on this. 3rd is harder. But my dad will lecture me and tell me #Arsenal need a trophy when I see him later...
 Well done #Arsenal boss Wenger. 'If a newspaper writes it, its because people read it and there's demand for it.' AW on Terry media coverage 
 Off to #Chelsea v #Arsenal. Can't wait, huge for Arsenal, massive for Chelsea & JT. Think Chelsea will win. DJ Tayo knows what I mean... 
Wow! More problems for #Celtic. Bet Keane's pleased he went... Rather like #Arsenal's bench warmer Wilshire at #Bolton. Give him a go!
Heard whisper that Theo will be starting for #Arsenal today.... Fingers crossed!
#Arsenal: Almunia Sagna Vermaelen Gallas Clichy Song Cesc Diaby Walcott Arshavin Nasri. Terry plays for #Chelsea
Bendtner on bench for #Arsenal
#Arsenal winger Walcott v #Chelsea's Ashley Cole. Fascinating battle
Thanks to all for support! I love you all too. Better be off to do the day job now... I like the #Arsenal line-up. Theo deserves a chance.
#Chelsea striker Drogba has 10 goals in his last nine starts v #Arsenal
 #Chelsea captain John Terry got fantastic reception from home fans when name read out before kick-off. #Arsenal fans booing,making gestures! 
 Drogba continues amazing goal run for #Chelsea. #Arsenal boss Wenger furious on touchline, wants theo and nasri to push on v full backs 
Bendtner warming up for #Arsenal
 #Arsenal boss Wenger not very gracious in defeat you'll be surprised to learn. Said Arsenal had more possession, didn't deserve to lose 
 #Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti full of praise for Terry, Drogba and his team. Drogba unstoppable against #Arsenal. Awesome striker 
 My match report on #Chelsea's win over #Arsenal. And to whink Wenger could've signed Drogba for £100k
 Listening to #Arsenal's Clichy get stick on Talksport. So unfair. He's committed, good full back, NOWHERE NEAR FIT but bravely plays 4 team 
 Not at #Arsenal for presser today, though back in time for #Liverpool game. Interviewing one of most famous people in world today! V excited 
 I hear everyone on Clichy but it's hard for me to criticise for once! He'll be a great player for #Arsenal, top pro, honest, potential capt 
 Could it be one in and one out for #Arsenal. Chamakh is coming in next season, Gallas may not be happy...
 Spanish radio: Barca close on #Arsenal's Cesc. Spanish media has habit of getting it wrong, let's hope so again!
@samuelruback At the third or fourth attempt/summer?! Maybe wishful thinking on my part! #Arsenal need him so much
 Off to #Arsenal v #Liverpool now. Arsenal need a big result, but Liverpool still not playing well despite improved results. 
 Right. Let me put record straight. I don't want Cesc to leave #Arsenal. He's a prize asset for the Prem. In fact, done my column on it 2moro 
 Wow! #Arsenal needed that win. Diaby the match winner but game ended in rows as #Liverpool blew it. 300th Prem win for Wenger, 450 overall 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger insists title race is back on after   massive result.   Good morale boosting win. Only bad point - Arshavin hamstring inj 
 #Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez fuming, says should have had a penalty. I thought it was outside. Arsenal also unhappy with free kick award 
#Liverpool captain Gerrard accused of diving during second half as Arsenal no2 Pat Rice made diving motions to 4th official.
 #Arsenal do have an amazing run-in. Lot of points to claw back, still think #Chelsea will win title but Wenger is offered hope... 
 #Arsenal's Andrey Arshavin will have scan on hamstring on Thursday, says Wenger. Nasri also had head injury, that's why he came off 
 @ChrisToronyi I agree. Hammer divers. But had so many tweets off Arsenal fans, denying Bendtner dived, accusing Gerrard. Imposs to govern 
 @ChrisToronyi Similarly, Arsenal fans think Gerrard's a diver, Liverpool don't. It's a free world but summat needs to be done 
 #Arsenal cannot afford to lose Fabregas - even for £40m. The Premier League needs him to stay.
My column:

 The #ManUnited result really sets up the day. #Arsenal really patched up today, big day for theo 
 #Arsenal facing a #Sunderland wall, Steve Bruce has gone 4-5-1, Ferdinand in midfield, Bent and Campbell behind Jones. May be long day.... 
#Arsenal winger Walcott had one-on-one but was too wide so had to look up - and guess what? no-one in the box!
#Arsenal hit bar. Bendtner shot deflected. Arsenal not scored in first 15 minutes at Emirates all season. Silvestre off line from Campbell
 #Arsenal 1up, easy for Bendtner to tap home after 27 mins following great run by Eboue. 
 #Arsenal still not killed this game off. Theo awful cross one min, brilliant run and shot the next. Typifies Arsenal's afternoon... 
#Sunderland striker Jones giving #Arsenal problems. This game not over by a long way
Almunia saved #Arsenal's bacon twice in a minute. #Sunderland boss Bruce claiming pen after Silvestre pulled back Bent
 #Arsenal put on Rosicky for Nasri, 72 mins. Nasri hasn't been great, hasn't been bad, rather typical of his season... 
 Theo subbed for #Arsenal, Sagna on, 78. Another frustrating day for Walcott 
 Four minutes added time, nervous end for #Arsenal as #Sunderland pile forward 
Penalty for #Arsenal!
Foul by Campbell on #Arsenal captain Fabregas
 #Arsenal 2-0, Cesc fires home. Points in the bag, 92 mins. What a shame so many had already left. Why bother coming?!

 #Arsenal striker Eduardo desperate to get back to his best...

 Got #Fulham striker Zamora, #Arsenal fans who leave early & Robbie Savage's 'you've never played the game' jibe in my online column tomorrow 
Got strong reaction of support to my #Arsenal early leavers tweet on Sat. I really feel most of u agree: wish people would support till end!

I'm on the Arseblog's Arsecast. Please give it a listen. U get my full views on #Arsenal rather than in my brief tweets!
Then on #Arsenal TV's Fan Forum tonight from 8.15pm. Looking forward to that.
 Serious injury setback for #Arsenal defender William Gallas. Wenger admits he doesn't know when he will return.
 Love these pictures of #Arsenal players Eboue, Arshavin and Bendtner. Been out before, but worth seeing again...
 Saw Ivan Gazidis at #Arsenal pressconf/Community event Thurs. Said it b4, but will repeat: impressive chief exec,nice guy & listens. Big fan 
 Interviewed #Arsenal defender Gael Clichy. On title race, his form, injuries and I asked him about Alan Hansen's MotD day jibe... 
I'm on #Arsenal TV tonight on the Fans' Forum from 8.15pm. Plenty on the agenda so please ring in...
 #Arsenal boss Wenger: I'd love Delap. Clichy on that Alan Hansen MotD jive.
 Really enjoyed #Arsenal TV tonight. Iyare was a top man, really good company. It did become the Gael Clichy show and I'm in Team Clichy 
Seen the Shawcross tackle again courtesy of arseblog. Looks horrific. Your heart can only go out to #Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey. Heartbreaking
#Arsenal showed incredible spirit and mentality to go on and win the game and what happened to Aaron Ramsey
Wenger said while ago he gets sick of opponents saying #Arsenal 'don't like it up em' and 'get stuck into 'em'. I appreciate what he means
#Stoke boss Pulis has defended Shawcross and says he's 'not a bad lad.' I fear Arsenal fans are going to be outraged about summat later...
#Arsenal's Theo Walcott in England squad too. Shawcross the big surprise though. I hope he sees Ramsey tonight
Apparently Capello thought about pulling Shawcross out of the squad after what happened at #Stoke v #Arsenal but stuck with him
I get sick of people saying the media hates Arsenal. What a joke. We're accused in Manc/Liv etc of being in love with Wenger! Perceptions
 Wenger spoke last month about #Arsenal 'don't like it up 'em' thing. Don't say media ignore it. Fascinating view:
There was more sympathy for #Stoke defender Shawcross than #Arsenal's Ramsey on MotD. Shame. Heart goes out to Ramsey.
#Stoke defender Shawcross will be at #Arsenal's training ground on Monday for England training.
#Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey will have surgery in London. Long way back for him. Wish him all the best
 #Arsenal fans need to remember the world is not against them. In fact, most neutrals would like them to win the league for style of football 
 @Miko_Gooner Crazy to suggest every member of media is anti arsenal as if its an orchestrated campaign. honestly, thats so wrong 
 @spiki67 But everyone, even Arsenal players, have committed fouls in the past. Will you blog on that? 
 #Arsenal midfielder Ramsey could be back in 6 months. They're hoping injury not as bad as Eduardo's. Reaction:
 #Arsenal striker Bendtner calls #Stoke defender Shawcross tackle “out of control, terrible and totally mad.”
 Good, thought provoking piece by Martin Samuel on #Arsenal, Ramsey, Shawcross. Don't agree with all but balanced:
Now let's switch public sympathy from #Stoke's Shawcross to #Arsenal midfielder Ramsey. Shawcross off to England training - at Arsenal's HQ
 Made my debut on ITV podcast, talking all different issues and THAT tackle on #Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey. Please listen:
 Hearing that #Arsenal's Ramsey in surprisingly good spirits, heading down to London and, as I wrote 2day, optimistic cos break higher up leg 
 And, by the way, the so-called Ramsey twitter site is fake. Checked and it's fake. Get well soon wishes to the #Arsenal midfielder 
 @thegoonblog Look, I hear u. But mirror and mail have been sympathetic to arsenal so it's not all tabloids so don't group us together! 
@thegoonblog ...saying there is a calculated campaign against Arsenal by smaller clubs. A conspiracy. How is that twisting words?
 @thegoonblog I hope u will hear the ITV podcast for my views, but this thing that the media has it in for Arsenal annoys me. Aint true! 
@Arsenal_myview Tried that! Got slaughtered on here for suggesting Sol for England. A few more performances like Sat...
 Former #Arsenal star Hleb desperate for return to Prem League. If u didn't know the story about his letter to Wenger, then it's in here... 
 #ManUnited boss Fergie rings ex-trainee Shawcross to offer support. #Arsenal's Ramsey back down south, in good spirits,sure of full recovery 
 At #Arsenal HQ for England training. Diaby out training with Arsenal first team, must be hopeful sign for #Burnley on Sat 
 #England boss Capello in defence of #Stoke defender Shawcross and THAT tackle on #Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey.
 @tomTAadams Blame Brazil! not Arsenal's gig surely, effectively hiring stadium. bet u miss the proper food! 
 Interesting interview with #Arsenal defender Sagna on seeing a psychologist after death of his brother
 #Arsenal duo Arshavin & Diaby to return v Burnley - fingers crossed they come thru training this week unscathed!
 #England and #Arsenal winger Theo Walcott set for World Cup chance vs Egypt
@Aphiss Arsenal
#England can rely on Crouch! 1-1. That's 19 in 37. Theo hooked for SWP. He's not been playing reg for Arsenal so Fabio cant expect too much
 Here's my full views on the #Arsenal events this week. Shawcross, Ramsey, media, but world's not against u! Link:

 oh dear. #arsenal capt fabregas aint happy, he's gone across to physio colin lewin for a word. diaby warming up. a worry 
 captain marvel fabregas scores for #arsenal, lovely ball by nasri. 1-0. now wenger may take him off! job done 
 #arsenal boss wenger wants to take cesc off, he is nursing injury, no doubt

 #Arsenal boss Wenger says   he will see on Monday   whether Fabregas will make the #Porto game.   He will have a late test,   said Wenger. 
Will try to find out more on #Arsenal captain Fabregas on Sunday. He came off as precaution but it's same hammy injury as before Xmas...
#Arsenal press conf on Mon ahead of #Porto game. Wenger said he'd be prepared to 'gamble' on Cesc. My hunch is he won't play Hope I'm wrong!
 #Burnley striker David Nugent tells #Arsenal boss Wenger: football is not a girl's game
 #Arsenal capt Cesc will have test this morn. Wenger says he's better than #Rooney. Still don't think he'll play..
 #Arsenal's Walcott may end up paying a fine - even after #Burnley. Almunia collects fines, hope it's good cause
 Sorry, but #Arsenal will be without Cesc for #Porto. The hammy means he aint in squad. More later 
 sol is training as is merida, clichy talking later at #arsenal press conference. eboue the joker says: 'cheese' at the snappers at training 
#arsenal striker bendtner last out to training - wearing the wrong top! at least he didnt miss it...
It's Manuel Almunia up for the #Arsenal /UEFA press conference. Got any questions? (That last bit was a joke...)
#Arsenal boss Wenger confirms that Cesc is definitely out of #Porto game. 'We cannot take a gamble on him.'
When I hear things I share them with my loyal followers. I would've liked to have been wrong this time in saying Cesc is out for #Arsenal
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Cesc def out, but Sol is back in squad. They haven't practised penalties and backs Bendtner. 
#Arsenal:Wenger on Bendtner: 'I am convinced he will come back strongly and Saturday was an isolated game. We have a good opp in both comps'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Cesc will have scan 2day. 'We're all convinced it will b a short lay-off, he has a small chance for Hull at w/end' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger on Cesc: 'it's always a recurrence on the same hamstring and we have to find out why it keeps happening.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger:'No-one will be complacent. It will be tricky game but we believe we can do it.We've got confidence and let's go 4 it.'
 #Arsenal boss on Nasri. 'If you ask any player, he wants to play in the middle. But I'm convinced he has enough pace for the flanks 
Just done emotional interview with #Arsenal keeper Almunia. He talked about death of his mother in law. He had compassionate leave in autumn
 Let's be honest, #Arsenal keepers, Almunia form and his absence, confidence and performances have been big talking point. I had lots to ask 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on why #Porto is too much of a risk for Fabregas.
My story:
 Now at #Porto press conference ahead of #Arsenal game. Their manager speaking now, promising goals 
#Porto midfielder Ruben Michel insisting ref - who #Arsenal boss Wenger branded 'incompetent' - was right to allow winning goal to stand
#Porto boss Ferreira confident that his team can win. 'We have the weapons to make it difficult for Arsenal. We will play to win and score.'
 Lots of #Arsenal news today. Plenty more later. Wenger on making Euro history, Bendtner, Nasri the new Cesc and interesting Gallas news... 
 Sorry, but newspaper stuff from #Arsenal presser embargoed till later. Up on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk after 11pm and in Tues paper 
@YouAreMyArsenal It's why u see different quotes in papers and websites from the TV press conference on Arsenal website. Sorry!
 #Arsenal defender Gallas broke down in training and, as Wenger said, is now 'back to square one' with his calf injury. Another long lay off 
#Arsenal's Gallas: his agents meet to discuss new deal this week. Club may 'bend' over 30s rule and do 1yr plus 1yr option.Will that b enuf?
 #Arsenal defender Gallas is 'back to square one' with his calf injury after suffering new setback. Major blow.
 #Arsenal defender Gallas will also have contract talks this week as Wenger prepares to bend club's over-30s rule.
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas should be back for West Ham at latest, possibly Hull on Saturday.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger tells players to 'make history' against #Porto. AFC never overturned away leg deficit in CL
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Bendtner, Bendtner on Bendtner and Nasri being main man. Big night ahead:
 #Arsenal keeper Manuel Almunia talks about the private heartache which has blighted his season:
 #Porto coach Ferreira on having the 'weapons' to defeat #Arsenal tonight. He was very confident last night...
 Cesc Fabregas on his commitment to #Arsenal, dream of meeting Real Madrid in Champs League final and his return:
 Good piece with #Arsenal no1 in waiting Szczesny. Wants to be no1 in next 12 months, being as good as Casillas:
Think #Arsenal will do it tonight. Big night for Nasri and what price Bendtner to score after missing a hatful on Sat? Big game for AA23
Hulk plays for #Porto despite long dom ban. Fernando out. My chum Lawro says that's big for them. Feeling in p/box that #Arsenal will do it
Had to be Bendtner! Always works like that. What a start for #Arsenal. Wenger says in prog notes that Nixk would score next one - and he did
And again... #Arsenal fans rewarded for their brilliant support and sticking with Bendtner on Sat. But Nasri struggling badly looks inj. 2-0
 #Arsenal bring on Eboue for Rosicky, hopefully for some fresh energy. Just gone a bit flat, still looking vulnerable at back. Not thru yet 
Dangerous times for #Arsenal. Nasri off the line from Rosicky. Need one more at other end to make sure
 Great goals from Nasri and Eboue put #Arsenal 4-0 up and on their way. Arsenal fans chanting:   Are you watching Collymore?   at Stan in p/box 
 #Arsenal have been awesome tonight, they have blown away Porto. When they looked edgy they dug in and scoreed two s/half crackers. 
 The quality of #Arsenal's goals has been outstanding, particularly Nasri who beat 3 players before firing home. He was my man of match 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger milking the applause for a great performance, even waving to the fans. If Arsenal get a good draw... who knows? 
 But why, oh why, leave early? So many empty seats - and now #Arsenal have a penalty... Super Nikc steps up 
#Arsenal hero Bendtner completes his hat trick. What a night for super Nick. Stan in great humour and the Arsenal fans loving the moment
#Arsenal boss Wenger hails Super Nick and says his team are ready to face #Chelsea or #ManUnited in the Champs League quarter finals
Brilliant moment as #Arsenal striker Bendtner scores a hat trick - and doesn't know you're supposed to keep the match ball!
#Arsenal striker Bendtner says Arsenal can win Champs League. 'Something we want to do and we believe we can do it.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger: 'If I don't smile tonight I will never smile.Overall we controlled the game,scored great goals and were good to watch' 
 On Talksport in the morning from 7am. Lots to talk about: #Arsenal's great win, #ManUnited preview and #Beckham's return. Please tune in! 
 Hat trick hero Nicklas Bendtner says #Arsenal can win the Champions League:
Do hope the minority of disaffected #Arsenal fans remember nights like against #Porto. U will never have it so good as under Wenger
 #Arsenal fans have never had it so good. Don't forget this week even if Arsenal finish empty handed.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger has ordered investigation as to why there have been so many injuries. Wenger on injury list:
 Sadly, can't be at #Arsenal press conf today. Most inconsiderate of Arsene to organise pre-Hull presser on a very rare and prebooked day off 
 I'm all Bendtner-ed out. But #Arsenal striker on relationship with Baroness Fleming: 'We're a couple, we are v happy and in love.' Aaaah!! 
#Arsenal been trailing the #Lille goalscorer Eden Hazard for ages. Been told they've been 'all over him' for ages. Value may now go up sadly
 Scores hat trick, gets all plaudits, dating Baroness who got £400m divore pay-out. So, #Arsenal striker Bendtner, where did it all go wrong? 
#Arsenal boss Wenger has set up a meeting with Gallas and his agent next Thursday. Wenger confident he will stay.
 Wenger spoke well on 'special character' Bendtner,NB's pink boots & the #Arsenal boss revealed he's been in touch with ref Halsey.Nice touch 
 @littlemsgooner Were you thinking with his expert handling, he may be Arsenal keeper of the future? (That was a joke before I get abuse) 
 At #Spurs v #Blackburn tomorro, will watch #Arsenal at #Hull, then doing Silverstone half marathon Sun. After 20miles last Sun,13's nothing 
why does bendtner wear 52 on back of his #arsenal shirt? karren brady in the sun says he chose number because he earns 52k a week!
Five Live commentator Kevin Gallacher full of praise for Arshavin and says #Hull 'can't live with #Arsenal at the moment.'
Gallacher calls the tackle on #Arsenal f/back Sagna by #Hull's Boateng a 'disgrace and unbelievable'. Hull down to ten men. 1-1.
Five Live saying it should have been a straight red. Ten men #Hull likely to shut up shot now and try to frustrate #Arsenal
 How many times does it happen? Team with ten men defend like heroes and are better... #Hull frustrating #Arsenal, who need 3 points 
#Arsenal have scored more goals in last ten mins of games this season. #Hull have conceded the most. Arsenal pressing and have 6 left
 6 mins added. #Arsenal have had enough play and chances to win, but there is time yet. They need to dig deep again, but #Hull battling 
 #Arsenal hero Bendtner strikes again. Great spirit, incredible. Who was giving him stick before? That stat improves again. Belief is growing 
@number_10 What do u mean back at Arsenal? He's been doing rehab for ages
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas set to return against West Ham on Saturday after training today (fingers crossed!)
 Here's my column part1: enjoy the ride with #Arsenal, great football, goals but spare thought for the full backs:
 Saw image of new #Arsenal kit couple of weeks ago, it was retro and v similar to this. Now this with old badge:
 Don't know whether Arseblog's image is 100pc, #Arsenal and Nike have never confirmed similar leaks in past. Think it would be best seller... 
 #Arsenal defender Gael Clichy wants Champs League showdown with Barcelona. Maybe he didn't see last night...:
 At #Arsenal press conference on Friday lunchtime for Champs League draw reaction, team news etc. Check live updates from 12.30 & more later 
 On #Arsenal TV on Friday night on Fans' Forum with Tom Watt and my Shovell, live from 8.15pm. I'd love for a few of you to call in. Thanks 
 @Gunnerian So fickle,aren't they? Course Arsenal fans would never do that. None were really fed up after Chelsea defeat and have now changed 
 Wenger on #Arsenal's #Barcelona draw: 'We're a good side, it's exciting draw, but we must focus on us. When u get to q/f u play good teams.' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger: 'You can only take one step at a time. We need a strong belief and we must keep that by continuing to focus on Prem'
Fabregas is back in #Arsenal squad as is Rosicky & Song available. Wenger: 'Cesc had test this morning and it was positive.' Told u on Weds

#Arsenal boss Wenger says there's no margin for error. 'We are in a position where we want to win every single game.'
 #Arsenal: Wenger says still in touch with Thierry Henry.'We won't be favourites, but for me it's 50-50, if we're at our best we have chance' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger on Cesc/#Barcelona canundrum. 'Worry in modern game is u don't focus on football.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Gallas is 80per cent OUT of first leg v #Barcelona. On Gallas contract talks: 'We have met, we will meet again.'

 #Arsenal boss Wenger much better with written press than on TV press con. Laughing, joking, banter. V entertaining.Sadly,embargoed till 11pm 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on lots of things after 11pm on mirrorfootball site. Latest on Gallas,Cesc's mum,Thierry's return & AW's biggest regret 
Plus #Arsenal boss Wenger on title run-in and why #Chelsea may slip up again. All on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk after 11pm. Sorry for wait!

 #Arsenal boss Wenger on worst day of his managerial career, funny about Cesc's mum, Thierry's reunion, title race
 Wenger on title race, why 'fatigued' #Chelsea could slip up, big weekend and #Arsenal can't afford ANY slip-ups:

 Took loads of stick from some #Arsenal fans this week after my full backs piece on website & guess what? Eboue starts at r/b, Sagna on bench 
 With under strength West Ham line-up, surely #Arsenal home win to go top? Mind you, Green has been known to pull off a blinder here.... 
 Nearly forgot: Bendtner on C League draw for #Arsenal: 'Wanted to avoid the big 4 teams, but I have a good feeling. It's an exciting draw' 
 Now concentrating on #Arsenal v West Ham. Here comes Elvis and the team... The Wonder Of You... Not a big fan of the song,but AFC should win 
 @donkiuw Later, promise! Forgot. We can do it, along those lines. A lot of confidence from #Arsenal they can do it 
Wow! A cracker from Denilson! And a dance too! Fabulous strike. 1-0. #Arsenal on their way to the top...
 Song and Denilson sitting really deep for #Arsenal, allowing Fabregas to get forward. Arsenal dominant. 1-0 up 
#Arsenal captain Fabregas getting harsh treatment - first Kovac and now Behrami. Arsenal playing some good stuff but WH dangerous on break
Song playing well for #Arsenal today. Clichy made great interception just before. Keep on saying: give him time and he'll b back to his best
 Sol booked for #Arsenal for late tackle. It was coming. The press box split over Sol, he's taking some stick here. Am trying to defend him.. 
Wanna know why #Arsenal get good press? Cos they stock the fridge with Ben&Jerry's ice cream. Just seen Mido nick three tubs...
West Ham fans singing 'Sol's going home.' First time Sol's played WH for #Arsenal since his infamous walkout. Booked & did 2 footed foul too
Song back in defence now for #Arsenal with Vermaelen off. Still think Arsenal will hold on even tho West Ham were always in first half
 I think my loyal followers know I'm a big Sol fan. But he's struggling today, #Arsenal defence rocking. #West Ham still in it 
 Alex Song head and shoulders #Arsenal's best player today. Great in first half in midfield, now commanding at back. Awesome 
Really think Wenger needs to make change. Bring on Theo for his pace to stretch West Ham otherwise #Arsenal will be pinned back...
Sagna coming on for Nasri. Ten man #Arsenal shutting up shop.
 #Arsenal defender Sol Campbell had great chance, saved by Green. McCarthy on for Mido, 75. Time running out, nerves, people leaving already 
 Cichy heroic run from one corner to another. The guy deserves so much credit. He's still going until end, shame some #Arsenal fans leaving.. 
Eduardo getting changed ready to come on for #Arsenal
Penalty for #Arsenal! Handball by Upson
Captain Marvel strikes for #Arsenal. Fabregas keeps nerve. The overwhelming relief replaced by chants: 'We are top of the league'
 Now at 2-0, #Arsenal fans are really singing. One of loudest atmospheres yet at Emirates 
 All over! 2-0. Sensational spirit and win by #Arsenal considering pen, red card. Almunia a hero. But Song utterly immense. Top of the league 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger: 'i felt (pen) decision was v harsh. we played with class, spirit and played an outstanding game' 
For all of u who want RvP news! #Arsenal boss Wenger: 'He should be back with us this week. Our fitness man has seen him in Holland & here..
 RvP Part 2... 'He is looking sharp. But he is still a month away.' See? Question especially for u lot, my #Arsenal top of league followers 
 #Arsenal striker Robin van Persie set to return to training this week - and could be back in a month:
 @ArsenaLOS Trust me, you can't criticise, question or debate any #Arsenal player or some numpty will flare up! It's like the thought police 
Think Sol will be OK - then it's just a choice: does he play v Birmingham or Barca? That should tell us #Arsenal's priorities...
We spoke to Cesc Fabregas after game and he was in confident mood. Out later and in tomorrow's papers. Feel good factor at #Arsenal
Loving Sky's The Wire promo! stringer Bell is an #Arsenal fan
 @ozgooner Just read that, thanks. Met Idris Elba (Stringer Bell) and interviewed him at an Arsenal game recently. He used to live near me 
Wondered why #Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas has grown a beard? For luck? Not gonna shave it off until Arsenal still in trophy hunt?
Nothing as romantic...! #Arsenal's Fabregas got infection and grew the beard to cover up his blemish. Even Superman cuts himself shaving...
 Andy Gray predicted on Sky that #ManUnited will be champions on goal difference from #Arsenal in 2nd. AG says #Chelsea third, 2pts behind 
Graham Poll on Talksport has slammed the penalty and red card for #Arsenal's Vermaelen and says FA should listen to Fergie rants. Amazing
 Also blog on Jimmy Carter, worst ever #Liverpool signing. Knew him from time at #Arsenal, smashing fella
 #Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner admits he faces battle to be fit for #Birmingham. Twisted ankle v West Ham, not trained since. Mirror l8r 
 #Arsenal striker Bendtner become v important, says he hopes to train before Birmingham, but do u risk ankle before Barca? Fingers crossed 
 @GManSizzle It's all an anti-#Arsenal conspiracy too, you know. We think: 'how can we knock Arsenal and big up United?' every time we write. 
A few have suggested #Arsenal's Alex Song as best young player. That's really PFA thing. He should get most improved player - 2 yrs running
But it's obvious that I am anti-Arsenal/United/Liverpool/Spurs/Chelsea (depending on which team u support) and will be voting against them
 This weekend will tell us much about title race. Think #Chelsea and #mufc will win. biggest test for #Arsenal, if they win at #Birmingham... 
Bet #Arsenal boss Wenger wont be happy with revisiting Eduardo/Taylor on day of #Birmingham game. What reception will Ed get if he plays?
 #Barcelona's former #Arsenal captain Thierry Henry on Leo Messi: can't believe he's human!
 Mirror columnist Mark Lawrenson says #Arsenal have better chance of winning Champs League than Premier League:
#Arsenal boss Wenger admits that Eduardo still not back to his level pre-#Birmingham two years ago. But what better way to really come back?
 Bad day for #Arsenal. Wenger lost his cool. Don't know why people always get so shocked, he's always had temper:
Am I going mad or did Hansen not condone the foul on Cesc? First time I've seen the goal against #Arsenal. Almunia: awful mistake. Again.
#Arsenal have major doubts over Carlton Cole's knee and why he doesn't seem to play twice in a week. Don't think today's story is right
 #Arsenal will get Chamakh on 5yr deal. SMirror done story on Hamburg's Boateng. Steve has great contacts at AFC:
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas confident of being fit for #Barcelona, old mate Pique has had text from Cesc saying he's looking forward to Weds 
#Arsenal press conference tomorrow ahead of #Barcelona game. Open training too in the morning. Fabregas will have to train to prove fitness
Will update all latest #Arsenal team news 2morrow. Cesc still a doubt. Does Wenger risk him and endanger him for Wolves? I fancy he'll be OK
 Confirmation on #Arsenal site. Fabregas must train on Tues to play against #Barcelona Will update u from presser
I'm at both #Arsenal and #Barcelona pressers tomorrow so will bring u latest on all injury updates. Nasri seemed OK Sat when he scored!
 @Thomaspemberton That's one tabloid. I think they're wrong, no idea why they think chamakh in doubt. I think he'll be an #Arsenal player 
 Fabregas's dad thinks Cesc will play for #Arsenal against #Barcelona, telling Spanish media he thinks his son will shrug off injury 
 #Barcelona star Xavi warns #Arsenal: you're heading for a crash in the Champions League:
 #Arsenal striker Bendtner hails #Barcelona's Messi as best in the world - but says Arsenal can beat Barca:
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas had scan on knee on Mon afternoon, has got 60-40 chance of facing Barca, D-Day on Tues:
Goodnight all. Off to #Arsenal training/press con tomorrow morning before #Barcelona's in the evening. Hoping for good news on Cesc.
Much more optimistic on Cesc today. Think he'll make it for #Arsenal. Update from training.
 Just done update for www.mirrorfootball.co.uk on #Arsenal injuries, inc Cesc. Much more optimistic. Hoping to make it. Further update asap 
 #Arsenal have got diaby, gallas, nasri, arshavin et al in training. no cesc yet 
#Arsenal captain Cesc had fitness test this morning and not come out for training
 Diaby, AA23, Nasri all in training for #Arsenal. Gallas taking part is major boost too but has he got enough fitness under his belt? 
#Arsenal boss Wenger due to speak around 1pm. update on Cesc and Gallas then
#Arsenal boss Wenger says on Cesc: 'at the moment he would not play but we will give him another 24 hours.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Gallas 'has a chance of playing.' Also confirms Diaby, AA23, Nasri all ok 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says he's named squad of 19 to give Cesc every chance of proving fitness, bur said: 'if it were today he wouldn't play' 
Wenger said #Arsenal will not be intimidated by #Barcelona. Wenger says: 'They are an exceptional side. But we are an exceptional side too'
Now arrived at Emirates for the #Barcelona press conference ahead of tomorrow's #Arsenal game. Guardiola and Ibrahimovic talking
Never seen the #Arsenal press conference room at Emirates so busy. is there a big game on?
#Barcelona striker Ibrahimovic says #Arsenal legend Henry 'was not happy' when draw was made. 'It is the club which is still in his heart.'
 #Barcelona coach Guardiola rich in praise of Wenger: 'One of best coaches in the world, changed the mentality of #Arsenal, won many titles.' 
I think Gallas will start for #Arsenal and my hunch is that Cesc will make it - but will leave a decision until late. It's a big call.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger rarely leaves decisions until last min, ignore all that 'leave it till last min' rubbish.But Cesc is exception for this 
 #Arsenal urging fans to get into stadium early, well before kick off to help atmosphere and so seats aint empty at k/o. and stay to the end! 
#Arsenal boss Wenger challenged players to 'make history' and 'deliver something special' against #Barcelona
 #Arsenal boss Wenger, in our newspaper press con, still angry at tackle on Cesc, I asked him about MotD pundit Hansen. not happy with alan! 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on why he would never ask a player to kick messi, arsenal 'will go for it' and more on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk 
 #Arsenal boss challenges his players to deliver a classic work of art against #Barcelona:
 #Arsenal boss Wenger will give Cesc until the last minute. Diaby, AA23, Nasri all OK. Gallas set to start:
 #Barcelona striker Ibrahimovic on breaking his English duck, trial with Arsenal and his critics:
 #Arsenal legend Bob Wilson says Almunia 'can be a great;. Check out Willo's first quote in this piece:
Thoughts? 
 Looking good for Cesc for tonight for #Arsenal. Don't expect definite confirmation till later, but from I'm hearing think he's gonna make it 
 Word is that Cesc plays for #Arsenal, Thierry on bench for #Barcelona. Gallas also to start. 
Cesc genuinely going to have a test in the warm-up but clearly #Arsenal think he will make it. Gallas definitely starts.
So Cesc is in #Arsenal starting line-up as I said - but one more test to come. Wenger genuine about leaving it to the last!
#Arsenal: Almunia Sagna Gallas Vermaelen Clichy Song Diaby Cesc Nasri AA23 Bendtner. As revealed in your Mirror! And called Henry on bench
 #Arsenal bench: Fabianski, Rosicky, Eduardo, Walcott, Denilson, Eboue, Sol. Barring of course that Cesc survives the warm-up... 
Former #Arsenal striker Henry got great reception when he ran out for #Barcelona. Cheekily tried to nutmeg Sol from 30 yards in warm-up!
 Thierry Henry has gone back down the tunnel to great reception. Hands above his head, the #Arsenal legend milks the applause! 
A Fleet Street colleague just quipped when ball went out for a goal kick: '#Arsenal might touch the ball now.' He works for a broadsheet...
 All is forgiven Manuel! #Arsenal keeper Almunia playing like Gordon Banks, Shilton and Seaman all rolled into one! Best keeper in world... 
 16 minutes gone and it's 9 shots to 0 to #Barcelona. #'Arsenal look in awe, is Cesc playing? Almunia certainly is! 
 AA23 struggling for #Arsenal, may come off. Eboue wraming up. Got injured when he got himself booked v Busquets 
 That's it. AA23 coming off. Eboue coming on. To be honest, may be a good thing for #Arsenal. Eboue can lift em 
 Afraid to say it's looking like #Arsenal made a mistake picking Cesc in starting line-up. He's struggling, can't get round the pitch 
#Arsenal defender Gallas has his sock rolled down and is holding his calf. Big risk.
Denilson coming on for Gallas. Song going back to defence then for #Arsenal. Wrong call IMO. Song is the only midfielder doing it
Fabregas booked - misses the Nou Camp. Can it get any worse for #Arsenal? Harsh booking
#Arsenal lucky to still be in this. #Barcelona look awesome. Gunners can only improve after half time
 Agree that Nasri has done well for #Arsenal, but has offered Clichy no protection. I think Song has been AFC's best player so far 
Zlatan breaks his duck in style. Song fallen apart since moving to defence. Almunia has stopped an embarrassment for #Arsenal.
#Arsenal look broken. Wenger must hope this defeat does not kill their season and rip their Premier League title challenge apart
Hope springs eternal. Cesc fires home a penalty but injures himself in process! #Arsenal 2 #Barcelona 2.
 #Arsenal supersub Theo said: 'Cesc is a soldier, he is our captain and we hope the damage is not too big.' 
 #Arsenal miss Cesc nxt week, Barca miss both their centre halves... Arsenal pulled off a miracle by staying in the tie, gotta be a hope... 
Waiting to speak to Thierry Henry. #Arsenal boss Wenger has said to french tv that gallas is out for the season
#Arsenal captain Fabregas going for x ray on his knee. not looking good for aa23 either
#Arsenal captain Fabregas admits he fears he has broken his leg. X-ray on his fibula tomorrow. Cesc on crutches and down when I spoke to him
#Arsenal captain Fabregas has had an X-ray tonight which was inconclusive. Will have further X-ray tomorrow.
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas on his broken leg fears. Inconclusive X-ray tonight, another tomorrow. His quotes:
 Ian Wright deserves as much respect as Thierry Henry as an #Arsenal legend in my view. But not all fans agree:
Spoke to Thierry Henry after the game and he said #Arsenal fans kept their team in it by getting behind them. TH: 'I will always love them.'
 Thanks for all Ian Wright replies to the piece. Lots of u #Arsenal fans saying: 'he's a legend, but...' Cesc update later... 
Don't think Cesc will play again this season. Desperate news for him in WC year. Better news for #Arsenal on Gallas - shorter lay-off.
Worst fears confirmed for Cesc. Hammer blow for #Arsenal. Broken fibula after Puyol collission. Gonna struggle for WC
Gallas could be back in fortnight for #Arsenal. Off to Arsenal press conference tomorrow lunchtime so more news and views then
Doing newspaper review on Talksport tomorrow morning from 7am. Then #Arsenal press conference at 12.30ish with latest news and views.
 Arshavin could be out for season.Plus #Arsenal boss Wenger's inquiry into Cesc's injury - was leg already broken?
 #Barcelona's Gunners legend Thierry Henry says #Arsenal's 'amazing' fans can have the last laugh in the Nou Camp:
Off to #Arsenal press conference at lunchtime - no day off for me. May be a scene from Casualty as Wenger will face more medical questons!
#Arsenal forward Arshavin confirms my story this morning that he fears he'll be out for season. another huge blow
My mate Bryan Swanson just did live phoner for Sky from press room at #Arsenal t/ground. Didnt tickle him while he was doing it - honest!
#Arsenal boss Wenger says on Cesc: 'We will have to fight even harder without him. But we want to focus on our targets and achieve them.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger insists that Fabregas's injury came from the collision with Puyol - in 'exactly the same place' as the injury at Brum
#Arsenal boss Wenger says 'it's not true' that he played with broken leg. 'We have two doctors with X-rays who will confirm that.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says they will have an enquiry about Cesc. 'Medically he was clear, he declared himself fit and u have to trust him' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger gives Arshavin hope of being fit for Man City. 'It will be at least three weeks. But 21 days now means late this month'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Sol returns for #Wolves.'Our main target is to win our games, but Wolves on good run and we must be 100pc focused' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger 'confident' in title race but adds: 'We cannot drop points. We cant complain on injuries as we have big talented squad'
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Clichy and Denilson are in squad for #Wolves. But Wenger says five weeks for Gallas. 'It was mistake to play him.'
 Wenger on Gallas: 'I am being cautious, maybe back sooner. He can be back for CL final...!' Doesn't think he's played last game for #Arsenal 
 #France boss Raymond Domenech brands #Arsenal boss Wenger 'irresponsible, outrageous' over Gallas. AW hits back:
#Arsenal boss Wenger also insists Fabregas didn't go into Barcelona game with broken leg - and has X-rays to prove it.
#Arsenal boss Wenger gives Arshavin may be fit for #Spurs game. AA23 says he could miss season. Wenger says Cesc and Gallas OK for WC
 silvestre and sol in defence for #arsenal, eduardo starts. bendtner and nasri benched

 #Sunderland striker Bent denied hat trick when Gomes saves his pen for #Spurs. 2-0. Still goalless at #Arsenal, Wolves doing well 
 Ref Marriner finds 3mins inj time from somewhere. #Arsenal running out of ideas, big guns from bench in 2nd half? Bendtner, Diaby, Nasri... 
#Arsenal fans show remarkable patience and support for Eduardo who has been wasteful and frustrating... so far. Still 0-0
Bendtner stripped off and ready to come on for #Arsenal. 63 gone. 0-0
Bendtner coming on for Eboue for #Arsenal. Expect Arsenal to go a bit more direct. 'Super Nick' chants start...

#Wolves boss Mick McCarthy hugged Henry as he came off the pitch and clapped him down tunnel. #Arsenal fans giving McCarthy plenty of stick
Nasri on for #Arsenal. Now things should start to happen. #Wolves fans winding up Arsenal fans by chanting: 'Engerland.'
 Rosicky takes free kick for #Arsenal, seems fine. Vela been summoned from his warm-up. May be coming on... 
 Vela on for Eduardo for #Arsenal, about time. 
 Five minutes left, 0-0, #Arsenal going for title. And yet still people leave. Please. Someone take their tickets off them. 
 5 mins added time for #Arsenal to stay in the race. More have stayed than usual, but still it empties.Don't they want to support their team? 
 That may be final chance for #Arsenal. Theo great chance, but miskicks after great pass by Nasri. 90 secs left 
Oh incredible! Bendtner 1-0 for #Arsenal
 #Arsenal boss Wenger does jig of delight down touchline, hugs Pat Rice. Those who stayed rewarded

 #Barcelona star Xavi says 'miracle' #Arsenal are still in tie. Guardiola: u could 'not even stop Theo with a gun'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger expresses doubt over Song's fitness. Wenger on Sol, Nasri and needing 'spirit' in Nou Camp:

 #Arsenal winger Walcott hopes for start after issuing high speed warning to #Barcelona. He's the man they fear!
 #Barcelona keeper Valdes singles out #Arsenal's Walcott as danger man. He's the man they're talking about here:
The taxi driver didn't give #Arsenal a hope. The Spanish media do though. They're really talking up Theo. Obvious who they fear. Goodnight.
 Spanish TV reporting that Iniesta on bench for #Barcelona against #Arsenal, ready to come on in 2nd half. Marquez and Milito set to start

 here's a quirky stat. with ref wolfgang stark: #arsenal pld 3, won 3, barca pld 4, won 0. 
#arsenal won 5-1 in milan with mr stark in charge! that may be a little optimistic...
 #arsenal have done well not to buckle in 2nd half, fought bravely. #barcelona and #messi brilliant. how bad was rosicky? 
 rosicky so disappointing for #arsenal. clichy ran his heart out, diaby decent, nasri in patches and bendtner worked hard.#barca diff level

 #arsenal striker bendtner honest in his views: 'no excuses, beaten by better team. now next 3 league games crucial, we want title' 
 - Disappointing night for #Arsenal, amazing for #Messi 
 Fresh from magical night in #Barcelona as #Arsenal tortured by #Messi, on Talksport reviewing papers from 7am. Messi to dominate again... 
No #Arsenal captain's address on plane home from #Barcelona. Disappointment all round. Wenger must lift players for title run-in
It's 3 in the morning and stuck in the longest queue ever at passport control. #arsenal fans not happy. luton airport: disgrace
#BerryGunner8 they do it for arsenal too!
So disappointed to see #mufc out 24 hours after #arsenal. shows prem is exciting but not the best league
 #Arsenal boss Wenger has made major progress this season - but will it keep everyone happy? Plus look to future:
 #Arsenal keeper Almunia: we must show big character at #Spurs to keep season alive after Euro exit:
 #Arsenal forward Vela dumped after his Champions League passport blunder:
 Interesting interview with #Arsenal physio Colin Lewin on RvP, Djourou back asap, changes in med dept & injuries:
 #Arsenal forward Arshavin on Question of Sport tonight. Quality, he's got plenty to say and is a great interview.
Defender of Tottenham. Ledley King? Yes it is him.' #Arsenal forward Arshavin scores on Question of Sport. Hope Ledley not injured filming.
#Arsenal forward Arshavin finished on winning team on Question of Sport. Obviously.
@Arsenal_Blog Just I find it utterly bizarre your first thought is I'm nicking the headline. Everyone in the media knows that headline!
@Arsenal_Blog I'd tell you who and how it was thought up but you'd probably correct me!
Wembley pitch a disaster. #Arsenal's stadium a glowing example. AFC built stadium trying to make pitch&football a priority. Wembley didn't.
Can anyone think of a player more consistently linked and yet nvr signed for #Arsenal than Sebastien Frey?Not done it myself for 8 years...
I think that #Chelsea Terry tackle was as bad as Shawcross on #Arsenal's Ramsey. Difference? #Villa's Milner didn't have studs in turf
#Spurs boss Redknapp blasts 'disgaceful' pitch. Harry: 'couldnt wish for better game up next than #arsenal.' kranjcar got 'nasty' injury
 Palacios misses next two for #Spurs. #Tottenham now 4pts behind City with Arsenal, Chelsea and United up next. Tough test for Harry 
 Sky News says Lady Nina putting her stake in #Arsenal up for sale. Been up for sale unofficially for a while...
Lady Nina has appointed brokers because no-one wants to buy her devalued #Arsenal shares so forget imminent takeover from Stan or Usmanov.
 And I guarantee that Usmanov is not currently interested in #Arsenal takeover. Silent Stan in no rush either, but may do in future.No change 
 Here's what I know on Robin van Persie - may be on bench for #Arsenal at #Spurs. But stress maybe...:
 #Spurs striker Crouch promises to take out FA Cup heartbreak on #Arsenal:
 #Arsenal striker Eduardo admits to Brazilian dream:
 Here's what I think is real story behind Lady Nina's shares sale. Sorry, but think it's a non-story for #Arsenal:
 What interests me is that Usmanov ain't buying #Arsenal at mo. But Lady Nina's sale not massive news right now:
Off to bed now. Going to #Arsenal press conference ahead of #Spurs game. Wenger talking at lunchtime will bring all latest news & views then
Silent Stan buying St Louis Rams doesn't change much - if he wants #Arsenal too then he can borrow a bit off his missus!
 Silent Stan's in no rush, #Arsenal board are relaxed cos Usmanov ain't buying. Lady Nina's shares been up for sale since Sept and no takers 
Sure Wenger will be asked about it at press conf today but #Spurs game Weds night much more important to the #Arsenal boss.News at lunchtime
#Arsenal boss Wenger completely poo-poos Sky's questions on Lady Nina. 'It doesn't affect me at all.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger confirms RvP is in squad!
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says he won't rush Gallas back. On RvP; 'he is a very important player, he can contribute as well: set pieces, goals' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger on RvP: 'the good thing about him in training is that it looks as if he's never been away.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Sol; 'I can tell u he will play.He's been good for us, he can handle it, I didn't think he'd play as many games' 
 Very quick snap news version of RvP back for #Arsenal and Sol to start, as revealed in Mirror today:
More later! 
 #Arsenal boss on RvP and Sol. New, full version of story. Wenger: 'my gamble' on RvP:
 @Aphiss No, depends. Arsenal are good to papers but suits radio and TV too - they can bang their broadcast stuff out live. Better run now 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger: boardroom wrangles won't affect my job or future:
Non-story this one... 
At #Chelsea v #Bolton. In press room already. Big week for title this week with #Arsenal at #Spurs tomorrow. But #Chelsea win would be huge

 #Spurs winger Lennon suffers setback and is out of #Arsenal game:
 Here's my colour piece on #Bolton's #Arsenal loanee Jack Wilshere. He had a decent game:
 For those of you that don't know, we newspapers get a separate chat with #Arsenal boss Wenger and often he is twitchy and unconvincing CONT. 
 CONT. when talking about #Arsenal Cesc's future. Yesterday he was strong, convincing when he said: he's staying
#Arsenal defender Sol Campbell returns to White Hate Lane. My blog:
 Off to White Hate Lane now for a bi-annual dose of hatred. I predict a draw so, judging by my success rate, either #Spurs or #Arsenal to win 
 #Arsenal bus arrived at WHL without much drama. A Barca flag, bit of booing but certainly none of the anti Sol passion of the past 
No Theo for #Arsenal. Eboue starts. Danny Rose starts for #Spurs
Arsenal: Almunia Sagna Sol Vermaelen Clichy Denilson Diaby Nasri Eboue Rosicky Bendtner
 RvP on bench for #Arsenal along with Fabianski, Walcott, Eduardo Eastmond Silvestre Merida 
 Was torn yesterday as to whether Wenger would pick Eboue or Walcott to start for #Arsenal. Eboue more defensive, Theo can make sub impact 
 #Spurs playing a million miles an hour, harrying and hassling #Arsenal. Rose's goal sensational. Nasri playing well for Arsenal. Great atmos 
David Ginola great reception on pitch at h/time from #Spurs fans. #Arsenal fans singing: 'you're just a sh*t Robert Pires'
Oh and #Arsenal fans: Come back to me when you've slagged off that song as many times as I have down the years. U annoy me sometimes
#Spurs 2-0. Terrible defending by #Arsenal. Spurs fans going mad - chance to wreck Arsenal's title hopes
 Walcott now getting stripped off for #Arsenal, about to come on 
 Forget #Arsenal fight back at the moment, #Spurs are looking molre likely at the moment 
Vermaelen has just limped back to the #Arsenal bench. He's clearly done bad damage
Here comes RvP for # Arsenal. 24 mins left
RvP on for Denilson who was utterly hopeless for #Arsenal tonight
Huddlestone been excellent for #Spurs. Tney've been more up for it tonight than #Arsenal who have been v disappointing
Best move of the match from #Arsenal. Great ball from Diaby to RvP whose spec shot forces great save by Gomes
 RvP hits amazing free kick for #Arsenal, another worldy from Gomes. Imagine if Arsenal had RvP all season long. Another great save by Gomes 
 Now hope for #Arsenal with Bendtner. But, in truth, it's RvP who has changed this game. 1-2. Tense finish for #Spurs 
RvP has been unbelievable since coming on for #Arsenal. Gomes must be man of match for #Spurs. Incredible
Sol beat Bale for pace in the 93rd minute! He's done really well for #Arsenal
All over. WHL erupts. Great game. Heartbreak for #Arsenal. Wenger right about RvP: world class. That's #Spurs' season tonight
#Arsenal boss Wenger has conceded the title: 'There is too much to do to win the title.' Wenger also claimed his team lacked 'maturity'
#Arsenal boss Wenger bigged up Sol - and made it clear a few of his players could learn from him. 'He has shown the way to some players.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger called Rose's goal 'one in a million.' Says Vermaelen out for 3 weeks with calf strain
#Arsenal boss Wenger also hailed RvP. 'He was exceptional when he came on. Their keeper made great saves to stop him.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger clearly talked up Sol as an example to some who were so poor: Denilson, Sagna, Rosicky, Eboue. Awful. RvP was gr8 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger concedes title, admits lack of 'maturity' and hails Sol:
 Nine years on and bitterness remains towards Sol. #Spurs won't win a trophy but beating #Arsenal close second:
 My column: tried to offer insight into #Arsenal boss Wenger's belief that Cesc is staying an his press conf:
 @Ari_Arsenal Thank you so much for your comments, support and sponsorship. Really touched, thanks 
 #Arsenal press conference tomorrow morning, bright and early. Stay tuned for team news and views ahead of #Wigan game 
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas not happy with Hill-Wood's comments. And Barca deny Hill-Wood's other claims:
 #Arsenal boss Wenger's quiet revolution this summer starts here:
 Off to #Arsenal press conference now, news after 9am.
Interesting questions ahead... 
#Arsenal boss Wenger: 'lets finish as high as we can. we need to finish on a high'
#Arsenal boss Wenger says 'we are in need there (defensively) so we may need to strengthen there.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger on Gallas contract: 'we will stay within our means.' on sol: 'he can have big part to play we will sit down with him'
#Arsenal boss wenger says cannot understand why players would go to spain'
#arsenal boss wenger on hill-wood comments. 'cesc would get in any team in the world.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says RvP will start if fit, but only if no gamble. vermaelen season over. aa23 is 50-50 for city 
#arsenal boss on gallas: 'i hope he will re sign but he is free to sign where he wants'
 #arsenal boss wenger: 'winning a trophy for me is the pl or cl, the rest are cups and not so important. nxt year decisive for us' 
 On #Arsenal TV at 8.15pm tonight for Fans Forum with Tom Watt and Shovell. Major talking points: title race, Cesc, keepers and what next? 
 #Arsenal midfielder Denilson is another injury worry, gone for scan on groin injury. big doubt. off to #Arsenal TV for Fans Forum at 8.15 
 #Arsenal news up shortly on mirror website. Wenger on keepers!, five yrs no trophy but AFC only team on up and his future 
 And thanks for all your amazing messages on #Arsenal TV. enjoy Brighton, Akhil! Go to Honeycomb Club 
 Finally! I pushed him on keepers for you guys and #Arsenal boss Wenger is no longer so convincing on Almunia:
 Wenger: #Arsenal not won a trophy for 5yrs, but we're only club on way up. Dig at Spain, Hill-Wood and cups:
 #Arsenal boss Wenger also asked on Lloris in our sit down and he said no go, too much. bed now cos talksport from 9.30am Sat morn 
Finally! I pushed him on keepers and #Arsenal boss Wenger is no longer so convincing on Almunia:
 Wenger: #Arsenal not won a trophy for 5yrs, but we're only club on way up. Dig at Spain, Hill-Wood and cups:
 I think there will be spending at #Arsenal, but only big by Wenger standards: centre half, chamakh and maybe keeper. maybe 1 more... 
Really hope Wenger keeps Gallas at #Arsenal and Sol. but need signing who can play 25 plus prem games. off to #Fulham v #Wolves
@Aphiss Yes. think #Arsenal wanna give him year with year option which kicks in if gallas plays set number of games. still think good chance
 #Arsenal must win at #Wigan. But to win title they needed to beat #Spurs and hope for #Chelsea and #mufc to slip up. Too late, but then... 
@eoin_heffernan Shame u dont read: i said arsenal needed to win at spurs to take advantage of slip which came today. twitters. sigh.
 @mattlawexpress deal in facts, not rumours... surely #arsenal would bite lyon's hand off: 8mill for eduardo! 
 Can I recommend that people follow @mattlawexpress. does a lot of arsenal, good bloke and is on the ball 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Almunia has 'wrist injury'. Yeah, right. No jokes about wrist injuries, please. 'Fabianski deserves his chance' 
 Beautiful day. Not at #Wigan, but watching #Arsenal on TV. Can see Emirates and whole of north London from my bedroom. Glorious. Away win 
 Sol is captain today, what a great reward for his display on Weds night for #Arsenal. Let's hope he gets another year, great influence 
 Flapianski should command, that's keeper's ball. Bad sign for #Arsenal 
 Let's not forget that #Wigan have struggled badly at times this season, they have beaten #Chelsea at their place.Hard game for #Arsenal 2day 
 That was a penalty! If ref gave pen against #Chelsea, that must be. Walcott cross handled. #Arsenal playing well, good reaction 
 Silvestre, who hopelessly gave the ball away a few mins ago, furious with #Arsenal keeper Fabianski for not being more in command. 
 No matter how good a shot stopper he is (shouldn't he be as a pro keeper!!!), Flapianski has to command better. Why #Arsenal need new keeper 
 Walcott not shooting because of lack of confidence for #Arsenal. How good was Sol, outstripped Rodallega for pace. Sign him up!!!! 
Hooray! That's how you do it Theo! #Arsenal have deserced it. The hard part for Wenger is imagining if they'd beaten Spurs...
 Mickey Silver! 2-0 for #Arsenal. Could've been pen at one end, now 2-0. #Wigan letting themselves down, no fight. Flapianski good save! 
 Didn't N'Zogbia always used to say: #Arsenal want to sign me... Er, no they don't. But why do some websites always pick up that nonsense?? 
 Three games left for #Arsenal after this. It will still take a two game swing, for #Chelsea to lose one and draw one. Still need a miracle 
 Great goal, but that would never have happened if Flapianski hadn't blundered for #Arsenal. Amazing win for #Wigan 
 #Arsenal fans pay big bucks for tickets, to follow team home and away. They deserve the club to invest in a keeper who won't let them down. 
 #Arsenal ledge Merson: 'Fabianski is useless. Until Arsenal sign a keeper they will never win another title.' Well said,Merse. Poor subs too 
 #Arsenal ledge Merse: 'I cannot believe it, I just cannot believe it.' Nice to see his passion, shame some players on pitch don't show any 
 Off to park, credit to #Wigan, what a fightback. But #Arsenal will do well to recover: awful on many levels. Flapianski must nvr play again 
 Listening to 606. #Arsenal boss Wenger has made mistakes - keepers, not buying in Jan, disregard of cups but to suggest he be sacked is mad 
 I'm on ITV podcast, discussing diff issues - including #Arsenal, Wenger, #Chelsea, #mufc, title race - and Rochdale!
#Arsenal were always going to get the train back from Wigan cos flights grounded. But hear some fellow passengers gave em some stick!
 #Arsenal boss Wenger: We're not going backwards, but I might be after Real Madrid's cast-offs...
 OK, I admit it. I'm going to be campaigning for #Arsenal to give Sol another year. Bit of keepers in here too:
 I'm a Wenger fan. But 3 big errors from #Arsenal boss in 2010/11: keepers, no buys in Jan, and dismissing FA Cup:
 Loved watching political history again tonight. Go Gordon. Bed now, tired. Back to business tomorrow and #Arsenal p/conf Fri lunchtime 
 Jeepers keepers for #Arsenal. Flapianski set for another chance, will they wait on Szczesny? Go on, Arsene. Sign a keeper! U need one 
 Off to #Arsenal press conf at lunchtime. RvP v #mcfc's Ade, Wenger lost it in d/room at Wigan, jeepers keepers, team news...Can barely wait! 
Alex Song and Eduardo back in squad for #Arsenal. Arshavin still out. Wenger: 'We must fight until the end. We are under threat from teams'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Ade, Toure, Vieira return: 'We urge our players to show respect. We want to keep line of conduct,no matter 1st game' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger: 'I want everybody to behave well.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says he forgives Ade. 'I'm stubborn, but not stupid. In heat of moment, you can do things which are not right.' 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger denies ALL transfer targets in papers. 'We're not in market yet, the transfer window not open yet.' 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Flapianski: 'I believe he has great spirit, great talent and wasnt only one involved in what happened at Wigan' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger denied Arshavin time and again - then he signed. So don't be fooled. Just doesn't want to undermine exisiting players
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Vieira will always be a legend. But says it 'was important he should remain so. 'He was a special player here'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger in good mood with us papers.Even bit of banter on #leadersdebate. But 'respect' for Adebayor?
#Arsenal boss Wenger never ducks question and still responded when asked whether he has 'blind spot on keepers.' Story on mirrorfootball
 #Arsenal boss on jeepers keepers, Fabianski - and yet may still drop the error prone Pole:
 #mcfc's former #Arsenal hero Kolo Toure on the Gallas feud:
 #Arsenal boss Wenger may be ready to unleash RvP - and says show 'respect' to Adebayor:
 @barciur That rule confirmedlast autumn, wenger spoke about it then, everyone knows it's coming. Arsenal have more players for b list 
 Sagna was unwell yesterday, don't be surprised if he misses out for #Arsenal today. His agent been busy this week: first going, then staying 
 Not working today because of marathon, so rare chance to go to a game and enjoy it. Cannot wait for #Arsenal v #mcfc! 
@GMMJohnson U seen the Arsenal defence?
 Just my luck... Get to go to a game when I'm not working and it was so dull, #Arsenal, #mcfc served up awful 0-0. Get well, Shay 
@howiehok34 What's wrong with Nielsen? And if your club's so rich surely they built youth team? Put kid on bench. Arsenal & Chelsea coped
 And what's changed since my self imposed booze ban? Nothing. Frey still being linked with #Arsenal, as he is every year... 
 @SweMeatballs78 Nope, my job isn't just Arsenal games... Like Ewood Park 
 #Arsenal would be proud of this Barca display: lots of passing on edge of box, possession, nice players, no cutting edge. Wenger heaven 
 @bozo_apparel Mexes is up there with Frey and Yaya as always linked, never happens. He was awful v Arsenal in Champs Lge 
 Didn't Arshavin say, before he came to #Arsenal, that he dreamed of playing for Barca. So why has he changed suddenly? All v odd 
 Arshavin at it again. On #Arsenal medics and supporting #Chelsea. Like his honesty, look forward to his excuse...
@GoonerTalk I'm sure he does. But he's not his agent. Check it with Arshavin or Arsenal and you'll see. Another agent working for him
BBC summariser Phil Neville says Fabianski having good game for #Arsenal. Natasha Dowie (niece) has made it 3-2 Everton in women's cup final
Ludicrous Flapianski has another mare. Shock. What do u expect? Of course Blackburn will target a weakness. #Arsenal should do that too
 Woeful finish to the season for #Arsenal and, in particular, Ludricous Flapianski. Never let that clown #Fabianski in goal again. 
A m8 (not #Arsenal fan) rang and said he's disgusted that #Blackburn put 3 players on Ludicrous Flapianski at every opportunity to bully him
 Sorry, but disagree. U should target weaknesses and Flapianski is a weakness. #Arsenal would surely shoot more if oppo keeper was injured! 
 And then again, #Arsenal are football purists and don't shoot anyway! This is such a frustrating end to the campaign. Wenger must buy 
Thank the Lord for @arseblog. As passionate as they come about #Arsenal but realistic to say it how it is. Any team shud exploit weaknesses
@onearsenewenger Yr in the minority on this one. So many people fed-up with #Arsenal not wising up and exploiting weaknesses to get results
 @OleGunner Yes, that's right. Not Fabianski's fault, not Arsenal's fault, not Wenger's fault, it's the tabloids! Classic. U gotta laugh 
 @NickJoys Thanks, Nick. It's frustrating. But everyone targets weaknesses - apart from Arsenal. Not condoning fouls. Up to ref to stop fouls 
@greedy013 What Fabianski need and what Arsenal may be different things. Hope Wenger buys new keeper and Fab makes new start
 Vented my frustrations about #Arsenal, keepers, future etc, on Mirror website for the lunchtime read:
 @harounhickman Buffon wants to come to England rumour? Yes, he's quoted everywhere. Arsenal? Wenger's always been into ageing big names... 
 #Arsenal defender Sol Campbell still dreaming of a World Cup call-up:
More on Gallas and keepers later... 
Think Sol has been #Arsenal's best player for past few weeks. Capello really rates #Spurs' King tho. Hard to imagine he'll take both to WC
 #Arsenal news up shortly on mirror site (I hope), Gallas stalemate, keepers, Szczesny likely to be loaned for 1 more year. Bed for me now 
 #Arsenal fear Gallas is going after he stalled on new deal - again. Plus keepers, Szczesny, Sol:
 Chamakh confirms he's 'totally' commited to joining Arsenal after 8 'incredible' years at #Bordeaux. Says he turned down Spurs, liverpool 
#Arsenal bound Chamakh also turned down 'incredible' offer from CSKA Moscow. Remember I told u he was coming!
 On Wenger report... Think #Arsenal boss will stay, already said that he'll sign until 2013, but Wenger drives a hard bargain, so patience... 
 Sorry, but still don't think a keeper is no1 priority for #Arsenal boss Wenger. He's stubborn... My column:
 Better news... What I've been saying all along, Chamakh on his way to #Arsenal:
 England boss Capello to check on Sol for #Arsenal on Sunday in World Cup audition:
 The headline's not right but here's my column piece on #Liverpool boss Rafa, #Arsenal boss Wenger, perceptions:
Really enjoyed recording @arseblog's Arsecast today. I get chance to express #Arsenal views in more than 140 characters!Pls listen to it! Ta
Poor Arsene's lost his voice. #Arsenal press conference off. I enjoy our banter with the Great Man. Get better soon.
Later on www.mirrorfootball.co.uk: #Arsenal boss Wenger dont take Champs Lge for granted and Theo interview
 #Arsenal winger Walcott tells #Spurs: we're still ahead of you:
 Wenger tells #Arsenal fans: stop taking C League place for granted.That's Wenger speak for no big changes needed:
 Back to work tomorrow: Talksport paper review at 9.30am, then later #Arsenal v #Fulham. Cannot believe season nearly at an end! Incredible 
 Off to Talksport, paper review at 9.30am. Lots to talk: England, Carra, Rio to be axed?, title race. Then #Arsenal v #Fulham later. 
 Really enjoyed Talksport this morning then saw Perry Groves, what a top man, him and Ray Parlour, #Arsenal ledges in the media 
 #Arsenal: Fabianski, Sagna, Campbell, Silvestre, Clichy, Eboue, Diaby, Walcott, Nasri, Arshavin, van Persie. Djourou, Lansbury bench 
 #Fulham keeper Schwarzer makes mistake to let AA23 score for #Arsenal, 1-0, 23 gone. Ironic cheers for Fabianski's every touch 
 RvP makes it 2-0 #Arsenal after good work by Theo. Capello was due here. #Fulham minds on Europe. Arsenal confidence back,fans singing again 
 #Arsenal on easy street, 3 0 up, baird og. #Fulham lost focus. walcott goes thru and misses 
 #Arsenal forward RvP guilty of one of those 'how did he miss?' moments, as first shot saved, then hit post from 5 yards. Still 3-0 
 Silvestre off inj for #Arsenal to a nice applause - farewell? Djourou on, good to see him. Capello had change of plan, he's at #Chelsea 
#Arsenal keeper Fabianski booked for handling outside box. Arsenal fans chanting: send him off.
 #Arsenal 4-0 up after lovely finish by Vela, a chip similar to a previous goal in Carling Cup. Good win, people bit happier now... 
 Chelsea 8, Burnley 4-2 up. Crazy last day. #Arsenal are treating us to a 'lap of appreciation' afterwards. Not a fan of those... 
Very much hope it's the #Arsenal players appreciating the fans!
 Wenger says #Arsenal have exceeded 'expectations' this season,but hinted no big signings as club must 'pay wages and respect business rules' 
Wenger says #Arsenal 'have shown strong character this season but conceded too many goals to win the championship. Congrats to #Chelsea'
 Pushed #Arsenal boss Wenger on whether he was concerned that the fans were calling for signings. He insisted he was, but don't expect many! 
 Wenger said Capello had change of plans and didn't go to #Arsenal today, but says Walcott in prov WC squad but hinted Sol won't be. 
 What an amazing final day for #Chelsea, Drogba. #mufc's Rooney is a worry, some natives restless at #Arsenal 
@YoungGunsBlog It's all an anti Arsenal conspiracy you know in paranoia city... nothing to do with controversial or eye catching moments!
 Here's my #Arsenal v #Fulham match report:
 #Arsenal captain Fabregas and #Liverpool striker Torres get World Cup green light:
 #Arsenal winger Theo Walcott: I wasn't ready 4 years ago, but I'm raring to go now...
 #Arsenal forward RvP: We must keep Sol:
 RvP says: #Arsenal still well ahead of #Spurs:
#Arsenal chief exec Gazidis tells shareholders tonight they have 'total faith' in Wenger and he believes boss will sign new deal
Here's a report on last night's #Arsenal shareholders trust meeting. People I spoke to impressed by Gazidis: 
RvP says: #Arsenal still well ahead of #Spurs: Great to have north London rivalry!
 @arsenal49er Hi. I said #Arsenal have bigger priorities than keeper. ie. centre half. think they may sign one & been looking,but not 100pc 
 My column this week: Paranoia City, #Arsenal GPS system and Capello. 
 @Davoody Been quiet as I've been soooo very busy. Cesc has a big decision to make this summer. In melting pot, but #Arsenal won't give up 
I made plenty of enquiries on Cesc yesterday. I think #Arsenal fans accept he'll return to #Barcelona one day. But it's a question of when..
 I believe that Cesc would like nothing more than to win trophies with #Arsenal, if they can be competitive then think he'll stay. If not... 
I also did story on Gallas yesterday. He's set to leave #Arsenal but still getting treatment at Colney to get fit for WC. I'm a tad annoyed!
 @TheArsenal_ Maybe... I really hope Cesc stays, not just for Arsenal but for the Prem. A great player. I was so upset when Ronaldo left too 
 #Arsenal chief exec Ivan Gazidis was great company at Football Writers' dinner last night, good guy and fans can be sure club in good hands 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger wants Cesc to give him 2more years plus few potential targets, inc #Fulham keeper Schwarzer:
 #Arsenal chief exec Ivan Gazidis picked up the Fair Play award before kick-off at Wembley. No-one really wants that award, really. 
 So Chamakh coming in, #Arsenal fighting to keep Cesc who is considering future. Interesting times, really want him to stay, gr8 Prem player 
Got lots of #Arsenal progs and team sheets Euro stuff too from this season. Too many for my small house. happy to give them to a fan
 Crazy day. Cesc begins exit route from #Arsenal, phone glued to my ear, in Munich en route to Graz. 
 Sorry, but he's going and it may get messy. Shame to end like this for #Arsenal. The story is well sourced, believe me 
#Arsenal boss Wenger coonvinced me few weeks ago that he thought Cesc would stay. What's changed? Cont...
 #Arsenal's lack of transfer ambition, end of season collapse and the fact that Barca want him will have swayed Cesc IMO 
Still in Munich on way to England training base in Graz. But am sad that Cesc seems destined to leave #Arsenal and the Prem League
 #Arsenal will not give up on Fabregas without fight, reminding him he's on long contract, skipper,there's been no offer and don't wanna sell 
 Really hope #Arsenal stand firm on Cesc, players accept big contracts so should respect them. But hard to keep players once they want out 
Fergie did extra year out of Ronaldo at #mufc. But hard after player tells boss he wants out. Sure #Arsenal will fight to keep Cesc
 My take on Cesc tonight. #Arsenal will not let him go cheap, don't need to sell, but he wants to go to Barca: 
 Sol wouldn't come this far just to leave, he's one player desperate to stay at #Arsenal. #Celtic can wish but Campbell wants to stay 
 Can a club hold onto a want-away player? Ronaldo, Barry gave it an extra year. Fear it will be drawn out, but #Arsenal face fight for Cesc 
 If Cesc goes, really hope for big price and #Arsenal boss Wenger invests in keeper, c/back and midfielder, else fans will be restless 
 Not just England-ing. Been enquiries on Cesc. Hard to keep player when he wants out, but #Arsenal standing firm. They say:not for sale. Good 
 @arsenal_block1 Don't worry, Chamakh done. It'll be announced soon, have no fear. 
 #Arsenal progs (nearly all home), team sheets, euro stuff up for grabs - all for charity. u must collect from me (n london) 
Done my online column for tomorrow (on mirrorfootball site) on why #Arsenal right to fight on Cesc and #whufc comedy character Paulo Futre
 #Arsenal dig in to keep Cesc. He's got longer on contract than we thought, Wenger quote and battle lines drawn:
 @TheArsenal_ Still gonna be a battle to keep him and still fear he may go, but Arsenal are fighting, believe me. Done my column on it 2moro 
@Arsenal_myview Don't think so. He owes me lunch
My online column on why #Arsenal right to take a stand on Cesc:
Thanks for comments on my Cesc column ( ). He was happy to sign extension until 2015 and #Arsenal right to dig in
Think Barca will make move for Cesc soon. But #Arsenal standing firmer than firm. Admire their stance and increasingly I think they can win
 Cesc not bigger than #Arsenal: 
Cesc's amazing Barca deal: 
Got 5 yrs left on AFC deal! 
 @Snir_Geuli Yes, still think there's a chance Cesc will stay. I think #Arsenal handling the whole thing really well and with great dignity 
Let's hope Hangeland was elsewhere - think he'd be great signing. But maybe that's just wishful thinking. #Arsenal like Schwarzer too
Bad news in struggle to keep Cesc at #Arsenal. His dad has spoken on Spanish radio: 
 On mirrorfootball.co.uk from 11pm: latest on #Arsenal and Cesc, transcript of radio interview with his dad, Vela and his passport! 
Plus lots of England stuff as World Cup builds up and a few #Arsenal transfer things - heard the rumours and they are NOT signing Hangeland!
Here is the evidence that Barca have tapped up #Arsenal captain Fabregas. Full transcript: 
 #Arsenal forward Carlos Vela on his Barcelona passport nightmare. Funny story this one:
 #Arsenal captain Cesc will quit for Barca, says dad: 
Full transcript of interview: 
 #Arsenal look at Schwarzer, centre halves - but they 100pc DO NOT have Hangeland on the radar this summer:
Barca going bust but still tapping up #Arsenal captain Fabregas. Where's Platini now? My lunchtime read: 
Barcelona finally make a move for Cesc - but #Arsenal tell them: not for sale at any price:
 #Arsenal take strong stance on Cesc and tell Barca: not for sale
 My column on #Arsenal and the Cesc affair: 
My column: give Walcott a break: 
@georgeyboy Not often I get star struck but did when interviewed #Arsenal fan Idris Elba. Now you get Lieut Daniels...
 Ian Wright was at Talksport launch. Can I call him an #Arsenal legend? He is in my book, and a top bloke. Stubbsy tops too. A good night. 
 Cesc blaming PHW comments for him wanting to quit #Arsenal...
 #Arsenal winger Walcott: Becks is my England inspiration:
 @colm_smyth I'm bit cynical on this one, excuses being looked for, but cesc charm offensive by arsenal may help, show some love etc 
PR guru and #Arsenal shareholder David Alexander #ff @calacus
 Hangeland is definite NO for #Arsenal. Joe Cole has got queue of clubs but I reckon #mufc at top. Laporta openly talking Cesc again, naughty 
Love the David Sullivan interview on #whufc being #Arsenal of EastEnd. Are they striving to become bigger than Orient?
 Joe Cole: I've done all I can to reach WC:
Think there's level of interest from #Arsenal, still think #mufc faves 
 FIFA must act on Barca's disgraceful tapping up of #Arsenal captain Fabregas otherwise their rules mean nothing:
 Joe Cole back training at Chelsea. He's in demand now - for club and country. man u, spurs keen,  arsenal watching. deal exp june 30no rush 
Really disappointed for #Arsenal winger Walcott - should be going to World Cup in my opinion. How Upson got in before Dawson a mystery too
 Barca confirming Fabregas bid is one thing,we knew it was coming. Negotiations is another. Takes 2 to tango and #Arsenal don't want to dance 
 Arsenal standing firm. Cesc not for sale. Hard luck, Barca. 
#Arsenal stand firm on Cesc: 
 Credit to #Arsenal on this, taking great stand. The arrogance of Barca defies belief. 
 Joe Cole has 100pc NOT signed for #Arsenal. Checked it, it's not true. They like him but Joe wants to concentrate on WC, decision after SA 
 To be clear: #Arsenal definitely like Joe Cole but no deal yet. Other clubs - unsurprisingly, as he's terrific - also keen.Decision after WC 
 Watched FIFA film of 2006 WC on plane. #Arsenal had most players at tournament with 15, #Chelsea had 14. If (& I stress if) Joe Cole swaps.. 
On Joe Cole tweets. Here's what I think: #Arsenal def interested. Lots of other clubs too. He'll make up mind after WC. #Arsenal got chance
Is former #Arsenal 'star' Julio Baptista Brazil's answer to Emile Heskey?
Seen what Laporta says but how can #Barca be in negotiations with #Arsenal? Their bid was rejected - end of negotiations.
Good news or the bad news? #Arsenal resolute that Cesc will not be sold Bad? I hear Joe Cole is no-go for AFC
 Everyone entitled to their opinion, I'm given to believe Joe Cole is no go. But am hopeful my Schwarzer to #Arsenal story will happen 
 Nice goal by Joe Cole after 65mins. #england 2 0 up. Sorry, #Arsenal fans still don't think he's signing... 
 Bye from #Arsenal Philippe and good luck at #Fulham. Senderos always gave his all. Not always up to it, but showed passion. I liked that 
 Oh, and Senderos's Dad is lovely fella too. Philippe cried in d/r after #Arsenal CL defeat at Liverpool. That shows he cares - wish more did 
 Before anyone says it, Senderos going has no bearing on Hangeland. #Arsenal not interested this summer, I'm told. Still expecting Schwarzer 
Joe Cole and Michael Ballack released by #Chelsea. Ballack will surely go back to Germany. Still don't think Cole's going to #Arsenal
 Ladbrokes make Joe Cole odds-on at 4/6 to join #Spurs. 5/2 #Arsenal, 6/1 #mufc. Bookies rarely wrong.Not a betting man, but I'd get on Spurs 
 #Arsenal put Cesc on cover of their new magazine - and prove they're not selling. Well done, great stand.
 Here's proof of what I've been telling you: #Arsenal in for #ffc #Fulham keeper Schwarzer and Gallas set to go:
 Ex- #Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole IS wanted by #Spurs and ISN'T on #Arsenal's radar:
I'd take him all day long 
 Here's my column on why #Spurs and Harry would be great for Joe Cole:
I still don't think he's joining #Arsenal.. 
 Here's what you lot have been wanting me to write... #Arsenal in for Joe Cole:
Would be great signing 
 Still don't think #Arsenal and Joe Cole is done deal. If he's signed then no-one's told board, player must go too (not Cesc) But AFC bang in 
 #Arsenal striker Robin van Persie exclusive: Holland can beat anyone:
 @DanCompton Hope so too, Dan. Wrote about #Arsenal's interest in Joe Cole last week if u remember, was assured it had cooled but now it's on 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger: Cesc not for sale and not interested in Yaya as Diaby improving 'match to match.'

#Arsenal boss Wenger on TF1 on bringing on Crouch:'#England need to consult with air traffic control'
Great to be on @sportsbreakfast this morning. JT speaking out backfired. i love #Arsenal ledge Wrighty's passion. #worldcup
 #Arsenal have gone back in for #ffc keeper Schwarzer, update on Koscielny, Jagielka:
 #Spurs boss Redknapp in for free agent #eng midfielder Joe Cole, trying to steal a march on #Arsenal and others:
 #Arsenal defender Sol in talks with #Celtic. They've offered him 2 yrs. AFC can keep him,but need to move quick!
Sol Campbell delaying decision on his future for 'up to a month.' Still think he wants to stay at #Arsenal rather than go to #Celtic.
 @potofstu Maybe, but Arsenal have made Sol an offer too so straight choice 
 The new #Arsenal kit is sensational, real throwback. It takes 8 plastic bottles to make it. It's red but green too... 
 Why #Arsenal boss Wenger should ditch his over-30s policy:
#Arsenal injury curse strikes again. Bendtner suffers new setback exclusive: 
 #Arsenal captain Cesc chats to English papers. He kicks off with: 'good to see u guys.' Polite, class:

 #Arsenal denied Wenger interview to Kenyan paper, saying it was 'not correct.' Set to be new no1, but Weng rarely attacks players 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger hurrying thru Standton shopping mall, Joburg, still polite to fan who just wants to ask 'one quick question.' 
 Mirror can do another #Arsenal win #worldcup front page tomorrow whatever the result. Oh, but wait, the press is really anti-Arsenal. Yawn.. 
Latest on #Esp #worldcup hero and #Arsenal captain Cesc and his future. #Barca snubbed again:
Plenty more #worldcup reaction to come. Lots of players stopped for chat. #Arsenal & #Esp hero Cesc shook our hands.
@arsenalkent Not really. Putting feet up. Joe Cole has to decide but #Spurs rivaling #Arsenal. AFC still have 1 yr offer on table for Sol
Got few days off (apart from Talksport tomoro!) But took delivery of new #Arsenal shirt - love retro style in a non biased way. Thanks Nike
 If only I had a pound for everyone who told me Joe Cole to #Arsenal was 'done deal'. Interested, but nvr done. Top deal for #Liverpool #lfc 
Agree with those #Arsenal fans saying big chance for Wilshere. Wenger will see that as reason for not pushing thru his interest in Joe Cole
@DanKing_NOTW Juan - Hear #Arsenal fans are going to a bar called Zen after the game. But if you're lonely try:
 Come on - cos Handanovic agent says #Arsenal not spending on keeper, u think that's it?! He's not #Arsenal boss and his player's a no-go 
 My main man @CharlieWyett has been at #Arsenal v #Sturm Graz. Follow him for updates. Top man, top reporter, shame about his team... 
 Written on #Sunderland in for #Eng keeper James for tomorrow's Mirror. Plus bit of #Arsenal, plus web column 
 #Arsenal hopeful on Sol, latest on Jagielka and still hoping Schwarzer will happen. Mirrorfootball website and paper 
 @fayecarruthers Oh, Faye. Say it ain't so. Moose's backing for Spurs would have cheered every Arsenal fan! 
 #Arsenal hope to keep Sol, latest on Jagielka, Schwarzer and bit of Eduardo:
 Here's a warning to #Arsenal captain Cesc as Barca look to offload Hleb:
Another part of my online column. Mad to look at #Arsenal winger Walcott as anything but hope for #Eng's future: 
Respect for Joe Cole to leave London comfort zone for #LFC. And it's a big chance for #Arsenal starlet Wilshere:
Sol to stay. Best hope #Arsenal sign Schwarzer or Fabianski could start season. Almunia in cold.On Mirror site
Sol was great influence for #Arsenal last season. V popular in d/room. Feel for Almunia. Good nite all!
 #Arsenal jeepers keepers. Almunia frozen out, if Schwarzer doesn't get done, Fabianski could start season:
 Couple of clubs in for #Arsenal midfielder Rosicky. Now Eduardo's gone, can't see it happening:
 Sol Campbell to stay at #Arsenal for another year:
 #ff 2 v good #Arsenal bloggers @thegoonblog & the excellent, well informed: @younggunsblog Plus: @christhewino @darrenarsenal1 @dancompton 
David James would be great signing for #Arsenal. He's free agent so do people really not think he's been offered?!?! Celtic talks Mon
 @DarrenArsenal1 Ah, the Arsenal Action Group. Wonder how many people remember them...?! 
Enjoyed my stint with Jonathan Legard @legardj today. Still a legend at #Arsenal even tho he's now an F1 God
 Someone naughty sent me this. Made me laugh. #Arsenal, #Spurs fans to a tee. Pls don't look at Joe Cole link...
 Really thought Sol was going to #Arsenal - they hoped so too, I think! Talks/medical at Newcastle. Could mean Wenger really MUST buy new c/b 
#Arsenal legend Ray Parlour just outed me on Talksport for texting him about the food at the Emirates - and eating four platefuls! Love it!
Off to bed for early start with Talksport paper review at 7am Weds. Check Mirror site later for strong #Arsenal transfer target.... Nite!
 Bit of intrigue... Arsenal aware Sol hasn't yet joined #NUFC. Newc have made him offer, had talks, are in pole, prob will sign but... 
#Arsenal go for Germany World Cup defender Mertesecker: Ideally 2 defenders wanted. Was told no-go on Marchetti
My thoughts on #Arsenal capt Cesc which nails pre contract nonsense.  Ramblings on Capello and Wenger also on site
 Could become a habit... Another day off. Park, shops and then cooked great Chinese meal. Covering #Arsenal pre-Emirates press conf Friday pm 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger defiant on Cesc, calls squad sizes a   disaster   and asks who told u we bid for Schwarzer? Er, your chairman... 
Very busy today after #Arsenal press conference as was on deadline but Wenger not overly encouraging on new signings. Don't need any...
Still think #Arsenal boss Wenger will sign keeper (Schwarzer) and a defender as 'ideally' he wants one. But not massively convincing.
@aystar If there's one defender #Arsenal would like in ideal world (now they've given up on Jagielka) it's Mertsacker - but depends on price
#Arsenal boss Wenger says his team can win title without any more signings: Bet people happy to hear that...
Wenger says Cesc staying for 5more years: #Arsenal boss slams 'disastrous' squad rules 
 Fly Mo is an #Arsenal fan, Farah got a good luck message from Wenger in his quest for a golden double. Brilliant athletics today 
 At #Arsenal, one of few watching Milan v Lyon. There's more Jack Wolfskin adverts than you can shake a stick at. What does he make exactly? 
#Arsenal: Almunia Sagna Vermaelen Djourou Clichy Walcott Frimpong Wilshere Vela JET Rosicky
#Arsenal subs: Koscielny Nasri AA23 Mannone Eboue Gibbs Chamakh Randall Nordveit Hoyte Yennaris
#Celtic look poor. Gr8 fans tho. #Arsenal 1-0 up and comfortable. Walcott and Wilshere looking lively. Frimpong in and out but 1 v good pass
 JET very quiet for #Arsenal. Go Sagna! 2-0, terrific left foot shot straight through keeper. Wild celebrations! 
 #Arsenal bring on Chamakh for JET, Nasri for Rosicky at h/t. #Celtic Zaluska replaced by Cervi. And no wonder. 
Eboue got an even bigger cheer than AA23 when he came on. Gibbs also on in straight swap at left back for #Arsenal
 Nervy finish for #Arsenal as, just like their fans, #Celtic never gave up. 3-2 f/t. Kamikaze piece of defending by Koscielny wasn't great... 
#Arsenal retain the Emirates Cup. Five years without a trophy? Pah. Don't believe it... Team from Faroe Islands next year just to be sure...
 Wenger full of praise for Wilshere and Frimpong, claiming they've now persuaded him #Arsenal don't need to sign a new midfielder this summer 
I also asked Wenger about #Arsenal's no1 defensive target Mertsacker. He was very coy in his answer. But admitted he needs 'at least' one cb
 #Arsenal boss also claimed Almunia must accept competition. I'd be staggered if he starts v Liverpool. If no Schwarzer, come in Fabianski 
 Rare foray into my hols. Cesc has put out a statement, apologising to #Arsenal fans, insisting he's fully committed to club. On site soon 
 Honest, good statement from Cesc. Doesn't gloss over fact Barca appealed but pledges loyalty to #Arsenal, Wenger.On mirrorfootball site asap 
Thanks for messages. Back from hols for MotD and #Lfc #Arsenal. Can't wait! Some things not changed tho: Schwarzer still rumbling on..!
#Arsenal ledge and top man Ray Parlour said on #Talksport that Cesc not travelled to #Lfc but expects Schwarzer to go through
 Not about the injury, but the tackle. Koscielny back out for #Arsenal. Bad challenge by Cole. But it's fired up the 10men. Almunia bad 
My wife has just asked: is Arshavin still playing? A great judge of the game. Truly awful in what's a big season for him at #Arsenal
 Now who plays for #Arsenal in defence nxt week? Fair result, 2errors, a good game. Reina just doesn't make those howlers for #Lfc. £23m... 
 To those asking on keeper, #Arsenal boss Wenger still wants new no1. Schwarzer wouldn't be asking for move unless he was confident of deal 
 @Aphiss Thanks. He actually said nothing of sort on Given.And us journos get stick for misquoting! Barton is #Arsenal fan, prob just wishing 
#Arsenal news up on Mirror site later. Convinced Schwarzer will get done. Djourou trained today and hopes to be fit for #Blackpool
@10akhil Good to see you Akhil. Arsenal TV legend
 Bed now. Written different #Arsenal fans shares story today, plus #Benfica in for Traore. Should be on Mirror site later, paper tomorrow 
 To those of you asking, I think Schwarzer to #Arsenal will def happen. But there's only so much you can say. You can't do a Daily Schwarzer! 
 #Arsenal and target Squillaci. After so many blow outs, maybe don't count too many chickens. But desperately needed. 
#Arsenal still got few targets inc Squillaci and maybe one last go for Jagielka. Schwarzer much further advanced. Web column tomorrow. Night
 Are #Arsenal fans happy with 4th place over a trophy? Yes, it would appear. My online column: 
@spiki67 @randomanomaly If money isn't an issue for Gallas why was it such a major issue with Arsenal?! He's now had to lower his demands
 At #Arsenal press conf forf #Blackpool game tomorrow lunchtime. Then Arsenal TV Fans' Forum in evening, from 8.15pm. Back in the routine! 
Then #Arsenal v #Blackpool Saturday followed by #Fulham v #mufc on Sunday. Matches are the best bit!
 @andrew14ad Talksport got hold of Barton. He said Arsenal was perfect fit, not done deal. Misquoted by tweeters who have a go at newspapers! 
@ColmMac84 Seen the Schwarzer thing. U know #Arsenal always leave it late! #FFC been looking for new keepers. Still think it'll happen
@Moose_talkSPORT Surely you'll be at Arsenal on Saturday...?
Gr8 irony if Gallas goes to #Spurs. Ex #Spurs capt Sol hammered for joining #Arsenal on free. Ex-Arsenal capt Gallas... What will Levy say??
 Off to #Arsenal press conference shortly. Can't wait to hear what Arsene Wenger says about Gallas going to #thfc... Diplomatic, me thinks... 
 #ff @pkelso Impartial, me?! The #Spurs board definitely didn't slag off Sol and then go and sign a ex-#Arsenal freebie themselves.... 
 #arsenal boss wenger causes shock by arriving early! RvP, Cesc in squad. Song is OK, Djourou short so maybe Song at c/half v #Blackpool 
Wenger confirms #Arsenal interest in Schillachi but 'not close' on deal. Doesn't wanna talk Schwarzer. 'We are short of defenders'
#Arsenal boss Wenger complimentary on Gallas but hinted that he will find it tough in n London derbies. Also denied his trouble reputation.
#Arsenal boss Wenger coy on Schwarzer but more forthcoming on Squillaci. 'He is one of players we look at.' That's as good as u get with AW!
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Blackpool will be 'dangerous' before talking about I Pods. In the old days players used to talk - not now, he says 
Djourou back in #Arsenal squad but will Song start in c/defence? Cesc and RvP may be on bench. Wenger says Frimpong inj 'terrible' blow
Lots more views from #Arsenal boss Wenger in tomorrow's Mirror and on website but embargoed until 11pm so check back then. Gr8 on Holloway!
 Leaving #Arsenal t/ground, heading for Emirates for 2night's Arsenal TV Fans' Forum 8.15pm k/o. Will @10akhill get thru? Make sure u #ff him 
A last ditch #ff @christhewino who has generously donated to charity in exchange for Arsenal progs and is a top bloke plus @DarrenArsenal1
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on good form: Scholes, bigging up #Blackpool boss Ian Holloway and 'conscience clear' on Schwarzer. Mirror site soon 
#Arsenal unfairly given rough ride over Schwarzer. Wasn't just going back with same bid.Few things up on site soon #ffc looking for new no1s
 On bizarre tangent of I Pods in d/rooms, #Arsenal boss Wenger did say he's got one. Can just picture him with those Dr Dre headphones... 
 Really enjoyed the #Arsenal Fans Forum tonight with top man @1yare
Now for bed then #Blackpool at Emirates tomorrow 
Off to #Arsenal v #Blackpool later. Surely a home win - but Wenger wary of 'genius' Holloway and #Blackpool: 
#Arsenal: almunia diaby sagna verm rosicky walcott song wilshere clichy aa23 chamakh
#Blackpool boss Ian Holloway adventurous in attack but 5 across middle when #Arsenal have ball. Visiting fans making racket at new Clock End
 #Arsenal taken lead thru Walcott after lovely move but #Blackpool done well, still in this and Taylor Fletcher just wasted great chance 1-0 
 #Arsenal look dangerous every time Theo gets on the ball. He set up great chance for AA23, just off. Chamakh goes close 1-0 
 #Arsenal midfielder Rosicky having a super game, pass sets up pen after Evatt brings down chamakh. Red cardm aa23 converts 2-0 
 Harsh red card and challenge outside of box in my view. Tough on #Blackpool, #Arsenal 2-0 up 
Lovely goal by Walcott on the turn 3-0 to #Arsenal. Nice move. Hard times for #Blackpool
Cesc gets great reception from #Arsenal fans as he warms up at start of s/half. RvP too
 Easy street, Diaby 4-0. Could be really big score if #Arsenal keep going. Sympathy for #Blackpool 
 Lots of old #Arsenal faces at game today - Keown, Hughes, Lauren, Parlour spotted earlier  and the wonderful Paul Davis 
 Theo hat trick 5-0, lovely goal. May silence a few doubters! #Arsenal can boost their goal diff here. #Blackpool partying still 
Here come Cesc and RvP for #Arsenal. Cesc amazing reception
Standing ovation for Walcott as he's replaced by Vela for #Arsenal
Vela produced beautiful piece of skill and trickery for #Arsenal. Woulda scored if he had a right foot! Chance went begging. 6-0
Every #Blackpool fan has stayed and is still singing. #Arsenal 6-0 up and going for 7. Mass exodus of home fans.
6-0 all over for #Arsenal and #Blackpool. Great they've stuck with Move On Up at final whistle. Curtis: ledge. Cesc great reception.
Those #Arsenal fans still here give great reception as Theo comes on at end to grab match ball.
#Arsenal boss Wenger on Theo: 'is more electric than he has been. He was sharp and I like way he mixed final pass with finishing'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on transfers: 'I'm confident that we will get one at least, plus one. Its quiet at moment but last few days go crazy' 
 #Blackpool boss Holloway: '#Arsenal is class, manager is class, way they play is class and they gave us masterclass' 
@paulhomer Ollie also said grass better than carpet in his living room and when Arsenal got ball couldn't get it back for 10mins!
Written up #Arsenal #Blackpool report. Rosicky outstanding as well as Theo. Enjoyed Talksport paper review. Now #Fulham v #MUFC
 Gallas to #Spurs 1 year plus 1 option. To provide balance, WG dedicated capt at #Arsenal, nice to club staff, coommitted charity fundraiser 
 Two sides to every story. Well managed, Gallas can be asset for #Spurs. Good signing even if few #Arsenal fans sorry about it 
I'm not a betting man but Schwarzer won't play for Fulham today - and still fancy him to join #Arsenal before window shuts.
@thegreengooner Gallas held out thinking he'd get more than #Arsenal offering. Had nitemare WC and offers went quiet. On less at #spurs
Danish papers running stories of #Arsenal not allowing Bendtner to get 'alternative' treatment. Not surprised after horse placenta fad!
 #Fulham boss Hughes was open about #Arsenal's interest in Schwarzer but says he just wasn't fit today, suggesting medical rumour is wrong 
Still think #Fulham keeper Schwarzer will go to #Arsenal by the way - just as soon as Hughes gets a replacement
Having look what's in tomorrow's papers on FiveLive after 9.30pm. Sorry #Arsenal fans but not sure Squillaci's impending move will make it!
 @nadderley Bit harsh, pal! Just caused outrage for suggesting I won't mention Arsenal's impending signing in my paper p review... 
To clarify for those with sense of humour failure. Squillaci set for #arsenal medical. Was joking 5m deal may not make paper review. Ok?!
 #Arsenal boss Wenger backs Theo for central role, #mufc boss Fergie unhappy with Nani, Harry on Bale's barnet. In Mon Mirror & on site soon 
 Former #Arsenal captain Gallas forced to take pay cut to join #Spurs:
 Wenger wants to make Theo a central figure for #Arsenal:
#Blackpool boss Holloway: 
 Here's me on latest @ITVfootball podcast. Prem, #Spurs star Bale's haircut, heroes and villains, #Arsenal's chances...
 #Arsenal set to complete on Squillaci: 
Latest (or not much) on Schwarzer: 
 #Spurs boss Redknapp going for another ex- #Arsenal star:
#Arsenal target Squillaci speaks well on why he wants to come in. 'Nearly impossible' to turn down Wenger: 
 Gonna enjoy watching #Spurs game tonight, Champs Lge draw tomorrow. Plus #Arsenal presser pre #Blackburn at lunchtime 
My column on why #Blackpool will win friends playing like they did at #Arsenal - but not many points. 
 #Arsenal press conference at lunchtime, lots to talk about today. And transfer activity getting going around the Premier League... 
#arsenal boss wenger confirms squilachi signing
 Squilachi not involved sat but #arsenal boss wenger says: 'he's a good player, at the right price and is a good signing for us. 
Denilson back for #arsenal. Koscielny returns and 'will be involved' says wenger
Wenger definitely DID NOT say there will be no more #Arsenal signings. Just bizarre answer where he contradicted himself. 1 more to come...
How can so few people eat so many biscuits? All the bourbon and custard creams have gone from #Arsenal press conference. I've not had one
 Just to be 100pc clear, Wenger said: 'I do not rule it out' when asked about #Arsenal making another signing 
#Arsenal boss Wenger said be good idea to shut window domestically when championship starts. Sometimes he's not v clear.
So another trip to Donetsk beckons. Eduardo is a great story. Braga and P Belgrade both winnable. #Arsenal have best Champs League draw IMO
 Former #Arsenal striker Eduardo relishing Champions League reunion:
#Arsenal boss Wenger back tracks on over 30s policy on Squillaci - and Schwarzer to come: 
#Arsenal boss Wenger on Stoke's 'rugby' style tactics. Subtle warning ahead of Blackburn perhaps? 
I coulda sworn #Arsenal boss Wenger has changed his own rules! Squillaci gets 3 yrs and Schwarzer set for 2 yrs: 
 On @arseblog Arsecast later, talking transfers, #Arsenal's chances and Wenger. Really enjoy that - chance to put over a few views 
 #ff @thesemgroup Could be good weekend for #Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs...
And they'll be welcoming back Eduardo to Emirates... 
 Really nice stuff on fans and Wenger from ex #Arsenal striker Eduardo - plus Champions League warning from Braga:
 Brian, the press steward at #Chelsea, offering chocolate biscuits. Afraid to say the biscuits better than at #Arsenal. 
Understand #Stoke fans upset at #Arsenal boss Wenger's 'rugby' jibe. But why do people say it's 'clever' when #mufc boss Fergie does it?
#Chelsea new boy Ramires used to be £2-a-day brickie and #Arsenal legend Vieira is his hero:
 #Arsenal boss Wenger bemoans Wilshere's England's axe from Capello:
 Big Sam: #Arsenal used to be dirtiest in league:
Wenger: We won't be bullied anymore: 
Big Sam: #Arsenal used to be dirtiest in league:  Wenger: We won't be bullied anymore:
Should be a cracker at Ewood. A defining moment for #Arsenal's season. Going to #Chelsea v #Stoke early to watch. Can Chelsea hit 6 again?!
 #Arsenal pass a crucial acid test at #Blackburn. Theo superb, great threat. Really impressive. Samba is a terrific player 
 Pulis says #Stoke written to #Arsenal, FA, Prem League complaining of Wenger 'rugby' comments. 'Very, very poor,' says Pulis. May sue 
@JamieDalton82 Seem to be lot of 'experts' around on Given. On MS: A deal with Arsenal is not dead - until 2 days (AA23) after window shuts!
#Arsenal trying to get Schwarzer done - and #Fulham keeper desperate to come to Emirates:
 Schwarzer by no means dead for #Arsenal. Still ongoing. But after Stockdale blow, #Fulham wanna make a signing 
Never let it be said #Arsenal boss Wenger doesn't help #England team. Has loaned Fabio keeper James Shea for training to ease injury crisis
 Schwarzer deal not quite dead, but not looking good for #Arsenal. Not down to Given staying but Stockdale out for 10 weeks was the breaker 
Barazite may go out on loan from #Arsenal. #westham also fancy traore on loan. Juve and Brum keen
Fear the worst for #Arsenal's title challenge without a top keeper. Don't understand why it's always left to last minute - and then nothing
 If #Arsenal got AA23 through then hope #Spurs get nod for van der Vaart. Great for the league, smashing player. Bend the rules! 
 @Arsenal_Away Don't worry mate, I can handle it. If u can handle a George Graham rollicking... 
My online column on #Arsenal keepers. Wenger's dropped bigger clanger than Hapless Flapianski. On Mirror site later/tomorrow
 #Arsenal boss Wenger's keeper blunder:
Some agree, some don't, some say back Almunia and judge at end of season. 
#Arsenal midfielder Nasri fitness boost:
#Mcfc and #England keeper Joe Hart wanting to become a legend like ex-#Arsenal no1 Seaman: 
 #Arsenal star AA23 says he's lost his mojo - but is more effective. Be interested in thoughts...?
#Arsenal star Walcott becomes first in history to win all of his first 13 England internationals. Previous record of 12 stood for 99 years
Schwarzer shrugs off 'bad back' to play blinder for Oz. One of the twitter news gatherers says Hughes 'confirms' Arsenal's interest. Shock.
Been busy with Rooney that forgot to tweet link on #Arsenal keepers. Not just me then: 
 Lukic an #Arsenal legend may be stretching it though... I remember watching him well. As I said last week, all about opinions... 
#Chelsea's Ashley Cole has big strapping on his left knee. No wonder #Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs on the #England bench.
#Arsenal winger Walcott taken to hospital for X-ray. If not a break then could be relatively quick return. But worse than a sprain and...
 Hopefully just a sprain for #Arsenal winger Walcott, so maybe just a couple of games out 
#England boss Capello: 'I just spoke to Theo. He tells me it's not such big problem. I said: 'Two weeks?' He told me less.'Good for #Arsenal
 Day off (well deserved, I'm sure you'd agree) so even taking day off from twitter. Then #Arsenal presser tomorrow and #Bolton game Sat. Bye! 
Off to #Arsenal press conference for Wenger's wise words at lunchtime ahead of tomorrow's #Bolton game
 RT from my fave Bolton fan.. @ColinBoucher Let's hope none of #Arsenal's players do horror tackle again, I hate it when teams play dirty... 
#Arsenal defender Vermaelen ruled out thru injury. Sqillachi will make debut. Nasri is in squad. Wenger: 'SS can do a good job in TV abs ...
 #Arsenal boss Wenger hails #mufc boss Ferguson's latest landmark as 'truly fantastic dedication, a great achievement' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger says: 'it's a little miracle' if u get everyone back and fit from internationals
Vermaelen has Achilles injury. #Arsenal boss Wenger fears about 'psychological damage' to Walcott after yet another setback
 #Arsenal dealt new injury blow: 
More news later ahead of #Bolton game - Wenger on Wilshere, injuries and keepers 
Written up my stuff from #Arsenal press conference from Wenger's separate paper briefing. On www.mirrorfootball.co.uk site from 11pm
Wenger in good form today on Wilshere ahead of #Arsenal v #Bolton. Plus a special read for u guys on keepers. Wenger clearly likes Coyle BTW
 #Arsenal boss Wenger on Almunia, Schwarzer and why his keepers will be good enough: Oh and him poking fun at me 
#Arsenal boss Wenger hits back at u-21 boss Pearce over Wilshere - and is heading for collision course on Gibbs:
 #Spurs boss Redknapp says he's   considering   making ex-#Arsenal skipper William Gallas his captain at #WBA. What a story that would be! 
Few rested for #Arsenal today. Bit of a gamble as #Bolton are tricky opponents.
6 changes for #Arsenal. Gibbs starts and Wilshere
Arsenal: almunia cesc koscielny rosicky song sqilachi wilshere aa23 eboue gibbs chamakh
#Arsenal scored 997 goals under Wenger in Prem before today. Who scored first and where?
Wilshere dropping deep again in midfield for #Arsenal. Almost 4-3-2-1. #Bolton striker Davies just won his first header against Koscielny...
AA23 just missed one on one after great ball by Rosicky. #Arsenal denied by super save from Bogdan
Davies booked after 18 mins for foul on Wilshere. #Arsenal boss Wenger said yesterday Davies 'is not a dirty player.' Not good on replay...
Hit and miss for Koscielny so far - today and in general. His fault as Bolton level through Elmander. Very poor defending from #Arsenal. 1-1
New style boxes for h/t fish and chips in #Arsenal press room. U get more chips now. Koscielny may not get battered (get it?) after all...
 Ball flew into the #Arsenal crowd, fan headed it spectacularly back onto the pitch before taking a bow. Take note Koscielny! 
A clear foul by Gibbs on Lee just before #Bolton red card. Tempers spilling over at #Arsenal. Attwell gonna struggle to maintain control
#Arsenal sub Diaby siganlling he will have to come off shortly after bad foul by Robinson. Only just come on
 Song scores #Arsenal's 1,000th Prem goal under Arsene Wenger. Great stat. Take a bow Dan Tolhurst for supplying the stat of the day. 3-1. 
Vela makes it 4-1 for #Arsenal. Fabregas's passing today has been unbelievable. Magnificent display.
 Gibbs, having been booked, gets let off for tackle from behind on Davies. Coyle not surprisingly very unhappy. Ref did #Arsenal major favour 
#Arsenal run out easy winners 4-1. #Bolton unlucky to have Cahill sent off. But Arsenal gonna be challenging this season. Looked good.
@nielsstampe It's all an anti Arsenal conspiracy you know. You must have missed all the goals.
#Arsenal boss Wenger on Robinson foul on Diaby: 'Challenge on Diaby was bad tackle. He is not in a very good shape. He cannot move his leg.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger: 'We would not have taken 6 points from Blackburn and Bolton 2 years ago. The players can handle these situations now'
 Arsene Wenger says it should be 1,000-nil to the #Arsenal. My match report:
 Presume next time twitter-ers accuse media of being anti-#Arsenal, this morning's glowing reports in every paper will be forgotten... 
 On Al Jazeera tonight from 8.45pm, look ahead to Champions League action. Then #Arsenal open training Tues morning and lunchtime press conf 
 Back on duty today. #Arsenal's open training this morning ahead of Braga game, then press conf at lunchtime. Diaby update plus other news 
 Nasri in training with #Arsenal this morning, Vela wearing silly hat but no sign of Vermaelen or Diaby 
Henri Lansbury has joined the training group at #Arsenal ahead of Braga game
Diaby ruled out of Braga and Sunderland. Vermaelen also out of #Arsenal's #Champs League opener
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Braga 'will be tricky counter attacking opponents. The 6 miles to Wembley is a long way.'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says: 'we are in a tricky group. Braga are a good team, SD are good team and we don't know much about PB.' 
 Wenger on Champs League: 'Tottenham can maybe cause a surprise but the best equipped are #Arsenal, Man U and #Chelsea' 
#Arsenal defender Sagna: Wembley not far away but long way from winning Champs League: 
#Arsenal boss Wenger bemoans refs after Diaby blow:  Wenger Braga warning: 
#Arsenal striker Bendtner insists injury hell coming to an end and his views on Braga: 
Off to #Arsenal shortly for Champs League opener with Sporting Braga. Prediction free zone tonight!
 #Arsenal superb, Cesc magnificent and a brilliant victory. Dunno where the balance is of Arsenal being brilliant and Braga being awful... 
 Wenger praises Cesc, says he never doubted his commitment to the club and says he's 'convinced' #Arsenal can win trophies this season 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says team can come of age:'They’re now 22 or 23 and continue to grow. I have problems to convince u, but that’s normal' 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger in full about his frustrations about unfair tackles. Not so much at Bolton, but the FA: 
Wenger on his Captain Fantastic's love of #Arsenal and why Cesc will lead his team to silverware this season: 
Here's my match report on #Arsenal 6 Braga 0: 
#Arsenal midfielder Diaby hoping for quick return after injury: 
Wenger on Cesc's love of Arsenal:  And here's my match report on #Arsenal 6 Braga 0: 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger in full on his frustrations about unfair tackles. Not so much at Bolton, but the FA: 
 @MattLawExpress Oh yes, and another: why is the media so anti-Arsenal, Villa, Liverpool, ManCity, ManUnited, Spurs, Blackpool, Chelsea,etc.. 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger 'under pressure' to go on foreign pre-season trip, keepers and Chelsea from the Q&A: 
#Arsenal boss Wenger under fire from Coyle and Allardyce:  Fergie better at talking about refs before games
Cesc was magnificent for #Arsenal in past two games - so why the long face?: 
No Diaby and Vermaelen for #Arsenal at Sunderland. Diaby set for #wba return as I told u on Weds. Still fancy #Cfc. Big test for AFC at Sund
@ashburton_grove No. Shame as he could've answered big sam and coyle. Have written an #Arsenal piece for tomorrow tho
 #Arsenal starlet Wilshere: growing old before his time, the big test at Sunderland and Cesc is no1 in the world: 
#Spurs boss Redknapp mocks Wenger's tackling moans and says #Arsenal used to have hardmen and play a diff way: 
 #Arsenal starlet Wilshere: growing old before his time, the test at Sunderland and Cesc is no1 in the world: 
#Spurs boss Redknapp mocks Wenger's tackling moans and says #Arsenal used to have hardmen & now play a diff way: 
Somewhat ironic #Arsenal goal from a Fabregas challenge on a defender. Hope that's allowed. Arsenal unlucky not to get pen
Desperate shame that for #Arsenal. Title hopes depend on Fabregas being fit. Sunderland playing well
ESPN saying hamstring for #Arsenal captain Fabregas. What u get playing 3 games in a week at top speed
 ESPN say foul count is Arsenal committed 11, Sunderland 1. Fear rush of cancelled subscriptions in north London! Their coverage is excellent 
Sunderland played v well. Big test for #Arsenal's title ambitions in 2nd half - and their centre halves. Been an enjoyable game so far
 Silly challenge to make when you're on a yellow, but red for Song seems harsh. ESPN say first time Dowd sent off an #Arsenal player 
@Chriskilley4 That's funny cos Arsenal fans not happy with them at all!
U have to admire #Sunderland's spirit. #Arsenal sloppy at the death in otherwise excellent display. 1-1. All going #Chelsea's way
This is an absolutely fascinating stats piece in Mail on Sunday. Clues for #Arsenal and #Chelsea? 
Blackpool fans now singing: 'you're not as good as Arsenal.' Note to Blackpool: Don't make Chelsea angry!
#Arsenal captain Fabregas facing injury lay-off. Scan on his hamstring injury on Monday for accurate prognosis: 
#Blackpool boss Holloway refusing to be drawn on who is better: #Chelsea or #Arsenal. But he's desperate to see it and how Wenger lines up
#Chelsea v #Arsenal weekend after next already shaping up as classic crunch clash. Test of both teams and their title mettle
Thanks for all replies. Even majority of #Arsenal fans reckon #Chelsea will win showdown with concerns over injuries. Shud be cracker tho
 @MattLawExpress Sorry mate, but your mini poll hasn't polled many real fans! My Spurs and Arsenal mates both bang up for it 
#Arsenal boss Wenger charged over Atkinson clash at Sunderland
Hard to swallow when players get badly injured and yet manager gets charged. Very un-Arsene Wenger like thing to do. #Arsenal
U gotta remember that Atkinson in charge at Goodison when Moyes got charged. So inevitable. But hard to tally against #Arsenal injuries
Wenger charge and Fabregas injury. If #Arsenal boss pleads guilty today he can take #Spurs as his 1 game ban: 
 Wenger on #Arsenal starlet JET, Fabianski, Vela. More experienced heads 2nite than usual, but plenty of changes: 
 #Arsenal say two to three weeks for Cesc. So, as feared, struggling for #Chelsea game. Major blow for Wenger 
 #Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has admitted charge of improper conduct and will serve ban tonight and pay £8,000 fine. via thefadorcom 
 @nadderley He can do my player ratings if Arsene wants to sit next to me. But then of course I keep on being told I'm so anti-Arsenal, Nige 
#Arsenal boss Wenger set to miss #Spurs game - but ditches Carling Cup policy to bring in big guns: 
@Des_Kelly_DM Musta been those Arsenal fans hacking into your account...
@YoungGunsBlog So let me get this straight: you deliberately misquote Arsenal player who's ranting at Wenger. I'd get slaughtered for that!
Just filed story on Arsenal captain Cesc from radio interview in Spain. Didn't change any quotes either. On Mirror site soon
And obviously no Arsenal fan websites on here will cut and paste the Cesc interview and not credit the radio station. #doublestandards
Fab koscielny rosicky nasri vela denilson wilshere djourou eboue gibbs lansbury #arsenal
#arsenal bench: almunia sagna xlichy aa23 chamalh eastmond thomas
Strongest #Arsenal line up for many years in Carling Cup. He may be in the stands but Wenger clearly wants to win
Minute's applause for bobby smith immacutely observed by both sets of fans. Credit to #Arsenal and great moving tribute by #spurs
#spurs subs robbie keane and #arsenal's chamakh embrace as old pals. From where?
Pat Rice barking directions from #Arsenal bench. Takes me back nearly 20 years covering youth team for programme and Islington Gazette!
 Wikipedia page updated already! Henri Lansbury's first senior goal for #Arsenal up there. Visitors playing well, strong #spurs bench 
 #Arsenal away fans are sensational. Never, ever a library away from home. #Spurs subdued. Rare such a 1 sided derby, gotta change 2nd half 
Wilshere running the show for #Arsenal. Sensational display. #Spurs' lopsided formation can't get close to him
Naughton lucky to stay on the pitch after foul on Rosicky. Booking. WHL eerily quiet. #Arsenal shud be further ahead. #Spurs will improve
Is Flapianski the worst keeper ever? Keane was offside before scoring but #Arsenal keeper has to save it all day long. #Spurs in charge
 Game of 2 halves, Brian. #Spurs in control. Caulker looks one for the future. Keane has made big difference. #Arsenal cursing Flapianski 
 #Arsenal have redressed balance slightly, pressing again. #Spurs still looking in the mood. Wenger's on the phone... 
#Arsenal sending hasty undercover messages from d/room from wenger in stands. Here come chamakh and aa23
Does #Arsenal boss Wenger's one match ban extend to extra time and penaties? Flapianski nightmare. Why does this all seem so familiar?
Is it written in stars for Flapianski to go from being worst ever keeper to #Arsenal penalty hero? #Spurs must be confident too
Split in press box over #Arsenal penalty. Dive or shirt pull. Nasri cool as u like though. Long time for #Spurs yet. Here comes Kranjcar
Gonna cause debate that one too. But Nasri showed nerves of steel to repeat trick for #Arsenal. 1-3
#Arsenal fans now chanting: Shall we make a DVD?
#Arsenal fans now chanting: is there a fire drill? as Spurs fans walk out. Don't shoot the messenger!
Harry doesn't look happy on touchline. Worst part is that #Spurs have just stopped playing. More #Arsenal fans than Spurs left in ground
#Arsenal been outstanding tonight. #Spurs showed good fight. Been great atmosphere here in WHL. Non event? No chance. Not for either team
Great night for #Arsenal. Wenger hinting afterwards he may take Carling Cup more seriously in future. Wilshere outstanding
 One bad point for #Arsenal. Gibbs has suffered another broken metatarsal, next to one broken last season 
 Talksport paper review from 7am (despite tube chaos). Arsenal, Everton and West Ham stories of the night. Chelsea playing kids tonight 
@mihirstar Clarify the 'completely focused' on Arsenal quote? It was out yesterday before the game and quoted accurately - unlike some!
 @mihirstar He was complimentary on Arsenal, that's what I went in on. It didn't even make the paper because we're filled up with a 4-1 win. 
Spoke to & transcribed #Arsenal's eloquent and interesting midfielder Tomas Rosicky last night. But his fave word is definitely 'definitely'
My column on why FA must back #Arsenal boss Wenger and Fulham chief Hughes and increase bans for bad tackles: 
My fave bit of #Arsenal midfielder Rosicky interview? He didn't even realise at Spurs that Wenger was serving a touchline ban! No link yet
 #Arsenal press conference at lunchtime ahead of West Brom game. Team news, views etc 
My web column on why FA must back #Arsenal boss Wenger and #ffc boss Hughes and increase bans for bad tackles: 
Vermaelen still out for #Arsenal. Diaby still has 'little chance.' Rosicky a doubt. Too early to say whether Cesc fit for Chelsea
Wenger says Szczesny 'is right' and deserves a chance for #Arsenal. 'He must trust us and no club has brought through more young players'
Wenger says he 'is thinking about' spending more time in the stands. He used to do that for 1st half when first arrived at #Arsenal
Eboue also doubt for #Arsenal ahead of west brom. Has test fri
#arsenal presser 2day as financial figures out fri. Wenger said: 'not easy to manage stadium and trophies but we've always played at top.
Wenger says #Arsenal keeper Szczesny will be offered new deal and says his moan is down to 'impatience being a characteristic of youth.'
 Vermaelen out for 2 games, says AW. #Arsenal boss looked somewhat surprised to hear Cesctargeting #Chelsea game... But didn't discount it 
Seen the very funny pic of Harry and an Arsenal joker. Amusing
Will never have another word said against #cfc's Ashley Cole who turned up to Diamond Club in tribute to #Arsenal legend Amanda Docherty
#Arsenal boss Wenger hits back at rival bosses:  Walcott on way back:

Love the #Arsenal-isation phrase. Other great Wenger sayings: 'financial doping' and 'footballistically.' Plus his worst: 'anti football'
 @DanKing_NOTW Great come back - tune. It's an amazing story. Glad u like National, not long till KofL. Hope to see u Sat up the Arsenal 
 #Arsenal star Bendtner says he's fit for #BCFC on Sat, he feels 'fantastic, in best shape ever' and back in full training. Mirror site soon 
Mistake in a #ff earlier... #Arsenal Fans' Forum legend... Akhil from Hounslow! @10akhil
Amusing slot on 5Live asking fans about rivalries. @sandmandave removed JVC badges from new Xmas pressie stereo cos they sponsored Arsenal
Back in the swing properly 2morrow after 3 glorious sleepless weeks changing nappies. At #Arsenal v #BCFC and in for the long football haul
 #Arsenal boss Wenger: I lie to press on injured players - but get story straight first: 
How is Manuel, Arsene? 
On Absolute Radio Extra for RockNRoll football after 1.30pm. @onejimproudfoot commentating on their live coverage of #Arsenal v #BCFC
 Walcott and Bendtner on bench for #Arsenal. Wenger's prog notes strong on tackles, calling for a PL summit. Also has pop at #LFC ownership 
This is struggle. My highlight so far has been natter and a nibble pre match with #Arsenal legends Davis and Parlour. Food excellent as ever
Zigic punishes wasteful #Arsenal with towering header. 0-1. Should Fabianski have saved? Nervy Emirates now. Arsenal bossed game so far
Penalty #Arsenal. Chamakh looking for it - and gets it. This will get dive debate going. Dann made contact so pen for me. 1-1 Nasri cool
Tempers flaring. McLeish arguing with #Arsenal fans behind bench. #BCFC clearly still fuming as they feel Chamakh dived. Game on now. 1-1
 #Arsenal 2-1 up now! That man Chamakh again, this time scoring. Superb feet, movement, lovely goal. Quick turnaround 
Comical moment. #Arsenal players took it in turns to pass square rather than shoot with #BCFC defence ragged. Still 2-1
Wilshere has been as good as AA23 was bad. #Arsenal have hooked Arshavin with Rosicky on after 70. Arshavin needs more consistency.
 Eboue booked for bad tackle on Ridgewell, the sort of challenge Wenger wants outlawed. 2-1 #Arsenal but #BCFC showing more ambition 
Here comes Bendtner for #Arsenal on for Chamakh
 Love Rosicky's attitude, he's come on and given it a go. V direct. Deserves run ahead of AA23 (Arshavin). #Arsenal face nervy last 5 
 Wilshere red card for bad challenge on Zigic. In fairness, not many protestations from #Arsenal. Late and high. Need all refs to do same 
Fabianski makes brave save at death. #Arsenal deserved 2-1 winners over #BCFC. Plenty of controversy though
 #Arsenal boss Wenger will be braced for a lot of gleeful opposing managers after Wilshere red, dive accusations and Eboue challenge 
Be good if Wenger comes out and condemns it. Would regain the moral high ground. #Arsenal deserved win but controversy by the bucketload
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Wilshere red card was 'deserved. We don't complain about the red card today.'
#Arsenal boss Wenger says 3 points was 'crucial.' Praised Chamakh and number of times his contributions as being 'decisive' this season
#BCFC boss McLeish refers to Eduardo tackle insisting Taylor 'not that sort of player' just like Arsenal will say that Wilshere isn't either

#Arsenal striker Chamakh refutes diving claims as he says they can still win title and his PL adaptation: 
#Arsenal press conference ahead of #Shakhtar Champs League game at lunchtime after training this morning. Europe returns with bang this week
Cesc back in training for #Arsenal - and here comes Pires. Cesc set to start v Shakhtar then. Press conference later
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says Cesc is 'ready to play' and 'physically ready. He wants to play.' Whether I will start him or not, I don't know... 
#Arsenal boss Wenger says RvP is out for another three weeks. But Wenger praises 'impressive' Chamakh and his 'team attitude and team ethic'
#Arsenal boss Wenger says he had word with Wilshere and 'quickly ackowledged' his mistake and 'deserved red card'
#Arsenal boss Wenger says on Dutch coach claim RvP will play for Holland on Nov 17: 'he has good sense of humour. No chance.'
#Arsenal winger Walcott has slight ankle injury but is in the squad for #Shakhtar game.
#Arsenal boss says Pires 'in great shape' and ready to join club as free agent - but Wenger insists no go for Arsenal
Former #Arsenal winger Marc Overmars was also at training - but just looking on. Theo gave Overmars a lovely welcome on side of pitch
 Just filed #Arsenal story for www.mirrorfootball.co.uk
On Cesc, Theo and RvP. Up shortly. 
Our newspaper chat with Wenger up after 11pm 
 Eboue adds: 'I did not try to kill the player, I went for the ball. #Arsenal are not a dirty team. Eduardo is still our brother' 
#Arsenal star Eboue says he apologised to Ridgewell after making his 'scissor' tackle
Written up #Arsenal stuff and now off to Emirates for Shakhtar presser where I'm hoping - I stress hoping - Eduardo will be talking
 Eduardo in good form at Shakhtar press conference, says he won't celebrate if he scores after 'three great years' at #Arsenal 
Shakhtar boss Mircea Lucescu says his team can 'create big problems' for Arsenal. Says he's a big admirer of Wenger and Ed near back to best
Thanks to #Arsenal's WIFI experts not just for brilliant internet service but the elastic bands holding my broken Blackberry together
#Arsenal boss Wenger happy and sad to see Eduardo return plus other news: 
Cesc desperate to start for #Arsenal while Wenger mocks Dutch boss over RvP: 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says #Liverpool #LFC 'too good to go down.'
Shakhtar striker Eduardo on his return to #Arsenal: 
 Cesc back in starting line-up for #Arsenal, shame Eduardo isn't for #Shakhtar. Wenger warm handshake for rival Lucescu. Mutual respect 
Good to see keeper playing against #Arsenal make a mistake for a change. Fancy finish by Song 1-0. This should be easy now
#Arsenal starlet Jack Wilshere lucky not to be booked for late and bad challenge on Hubschman. Just 3 days after his red card too...
#Arsenal on easy street now. And here comes Rebecca Adlington for a half time lap of honour with fellow swimmers. Getting a great reception
Mummy's boy Cesc Fabregas reveals Felicitas Mama on T-shirt after netting penalty. Massive for #Arsenal to have him back in side
Easy street for #Arsenal. Super display as Shakhtar made to look second rate. Nasri outstanding tonight. As are the bare chested away fans
Eduardo completes his dream return - and no celebration in sight. Got a bigger cheer than most of the #Arsenal goals. Nice touch. 5-1
Got to get on the hobby horse again... Where have all the fans gone? Emirates is half empty and #Arsenal are winning 5-1. Bizarre
 Great win for #Arsenal, 14 goals in first 3 Group games beats Real Madrid record. Doing Talksport newspaper review in the morning from 7am 
Off to #Arsenal AGM. Am looking forward to seeing a few faces and expect 1 or 2 announcements. And Peter Hill Wood great entertainment
 Why Fabio should look to Wales for his England team:
Ex-#Arsenal striker Bothroyd in great form for #Cardiff
What's happened to Andrey Arshavin this season? Not at his brilliant best for #Arsenal. My column:
#Arsenal legend Maria Petri (Come on you Gunners) got great reception after criticising fact that no fans allowed at #Arsenal games. Shame
#Arsenal AGM: which other club's fans would applaud a manager for signing new deal after not winning a trophy for 5yrs?! Great support
 Great to see so many good people at #Arsenal AGM. Wenger addresses audience: I'm here, will answer any and as many questions. Class

twists & turns, #mcfc v #Arsenal previews, player uncertainty at #LFC 
 Cannot wait for the game from Eastlands. Man City raise themselves for big games, hard to break down but fancy #Arsenal to win today 
 So much for #mcfc being negative, they're getting round the back of #Arsenal defence easily... Centre halves rocky, City benefiting 
Super goal for #Arsenal 1-0. This is going to be Nasri's year. He's in the mood
 #Arsenal started 2nd half well and clearly someone has told Djourou to get tighter, be more tenacious. He'll need to now Ade on for #mcfc 
Wow. Has Fabianski finally got it licked? Djourou still not inspiring confidence in the #Arsenal defence
 #Arsenal played so well, super goal by Song. #mcfc not finished yet tho, they've shown plenty of spirit 
 Arshavin done well, set up a goal but, blimey, was he blowing towards the end. Rosicky has been great recently coming on for #Arsenal 
 Brilliant play by Nasri to set up Bendtner for #Arsenal's third. Nasri has been exceptional today. Big win against #mcfc, huge boost 
 You said it, Cesc. 'I missed a penalty, how can I be man of the match?' Nasri was on another level for #Arsenal today 
@MattLawExpress I sincerely hope you're not suggesting Arsenal would kick someone deliberately. That's 'anti football'

 #Arsenal boss Wenger admits he was 'relieved.' AW: 'Great attitude and we have matured. When it does not go for us, the players remain calm' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger: 'We need to show consistency and we need to step up gear to achieve that. Can we keep players fit? Then have chance'
#Arsenal boss Wenger feared Cesc had flare up of hamstring injury and nearly took him off at half time

#Arsenal under severe pressure in Donetsk. Djourou doing well tonight and Fabianski made a brilliant save. It's been coming.... 1-1
 Eastmond showing real character now for #Arsenal. Could have affected him, but he's got his head up and just drove a dangerous attack. 1-1 
Brilliant touch that. Ref has ordered #Arsenal captain Rosicky to apologise to the Shakhtar player he just fouled. And he didn't get booked

#Arsenal assistant boss Pat Rice has whistled down the line. Cue AA23 to get stripped
AA23 for Nasri who has been hobbling since first half. Still done well though. #Arsenal need to get going. And here comes RvP!
 No surprise Chamakh comes off. He needs a rest, looked tired lately. Now RvP and AA23 need to get #Arsenal going as #NUFC look comfortable 
Fabio looks typically severe when pictured in #Arsenal directors' box. Not even he could fail to have been impressed by Carroll
And here comes Bendtner. #Arsenal going for it
Still waiting for the #Arsenal cavalry. #NUFC have worked so hard for this. Wenger's men looked flat today

Don't think Koscielny is good enough for #Arsenal. There. I said it. Has done OK in some games but has also consistently been exposed
 Wenger odd excuse on Fabianski, claiming #Arsenal keeper was 'too confident, didn't expect to be challenged.' Says AFC just plain 'unlucky'

 And to prove a point, don't agree with #Arsenal boss Wenger on Braga approach. It's up to Arsenal to break them down if they're better

 Chances, chances, chances... #Arsenal very dominant - and wasteful. 
 Didn't AA23 just leave Pires on his backside? #Arsenal will regret this, it's written in stars. No final ball though, disappointing 
Superb finish by AA23. And I always tempt fate! How did Nasri miss that for #Arsenal? Harder chance last week
Was just about to text 'Crisis? What crisis?' Then remembered what happened when #Arsenal led 2-0 at h/t last Sat. #afc bossing #avfc
 Carew unable to interrupt Delfonso's prayer before kick off. Well done, young man. Can't be having neck scarves on players. #AVFC #Arsenal 
Chamakh shows Bendtner what being #Arsenal centre forward is about. Huge goal that as #AVFC were right back in it. Pires needs matches
 If #Arsenal don't win this game then it will really hit them for six. Villa really coming back strong, incredible spirit 
Crazy how game still in balance. Says much about #Arsenal and their inability to shut games down. Villa will have at least one more chance
 Wilshere kisses the badge, celebrates with fans, great finish for #Arsenal. Top of the Premier League. What an end to the week for Wenger 
@ColinBoucher Feel for BRfans. But when I question scoreline it's dismissed as being pro Arsenal. Not true. Just think scoreline a shocker
Always expected #mufc to win. But in that manner? No Arsenal agenda just think that scoreline not right and BR fans deserve refunds

 #Arsenal forward Arshavin, a star of Russia's winning 2018 bid, given bit of stick by #Fulham fans. Hardly a gauntlet of hate... 
Though one #Arsenal fan near press box tried his best to shout into BBC Five Five mic in anger about FIFA
Great chance for Arshavin to give #Arsenal lead but Schwarzer blocks. Must be why they wanted to sign him...
Is it the nerves about the poor home form or have people forgotten #Arsenal going for title? So subdued and low key. So disappointing. 0-0
Stand up if you hate Arshavin! #Fulham #FFC fans make their point about #Arsenal's Russian World Cup diplomat
Oh that's brilliant. Two sublime dummies from Nasri before firing home 1-0 #Arsenal. Superb
Dummies out of Ricky Villa school of penalty box trickery. #Arsenal crowd roared again when replay shown on big screens of Nasri finish
#Arsenal legend Thierry Henry in the crowd and would have enjoyed Nasri finish
BBC website does Prem table as live. #Arsenal currently top...
 Old pals and old flatmates (well, shared digs) #Arsenal captain Fabregas and #FFC #Fulham defender Senderos sat together, chatting 
#Arsenal midfielder Nasri has got a snood and gloves on. Why? The amount of work he's doing will keep him warm. Having season of his life
 Nasri sensational run and cross again for #Arsenal. Song goes close, too. Is Song still a defensive midfielder? #Fulham making sub 
 Briggs taken off by #Fulham, Baird on for #FFC. Briggs utterly destroyed by Nasri in 28 mins. #Arsenal 
Koscielny and Squillaci collided with each other! Clowns. Kamara puts #Fulham level. #Arsenal soft centre exposed again.
 Koscielny played on after collision with Squillaci, then went down holding face before going down. Concussion? Djourou coming on. #Arsenal 
Koscielny stretchered off for #Arsenal. What's gone before at home will haunt Arsenal and play on their minds. They must win this
Looked to be more Koscielny's ball. Squillaci went for it and headbutted his #Arsenal team mate. They both speak French. Talk to each other!
#Arsenal soft centre exposed again as Kamara went clean through but denied by Fabianski. Chamakh had gone close. Arsenal so weak at back
 This is mad. U could drive a double decker bus through #Arsenal defence. Embarrassing now. If half were 10 mins longer, #FFC would score 2 
Second half underway at #Arsenal. #Fulham finished so strongly. Let's see who made the better team talk...
Theo begins warming up for #Arsenal...
 Song rampaging forward again for #Arsenal. Has he changed his position or has Wenger? Either way, it leaves defence hopelessly exposed 
#Chelsea #CFC are top of the Premier League as it stands on BBC website. Do #Arsenal want to win title or not? Seem intimidated to me
 RvP on for Rocisky, Right, it's up to van Persie to make a difference for #Arsenal for first time this season. It's December. 
If Mark Hughes goes for it and puts on #FFC #Fulham sub Andy Johnson then they can win it on the break. #Arsenal so vulnerable
 Again, #Arsenal midfielder Song most advanced player as he fires over. Who has convinced him he's Messi? AFC no longer have a def midfielder 
 #Arsenal midfield playing with no shape, discipline or anchorman. It's open season. If this were England, we'd be killing Capello's tactics 
Here comes Theo for #Arsenal. Take Song off and make Walcott holding midfielder. Would be as effective
Walcott on for Wilshere. If Song doesn't sit and hold position now then #Arsenal are in trouble
 Speaking of which, there's Fabio in the stands at #Arsenal. 
 Nasri scores and saves the day for #Arsenal. He's incredible, incredible goal. Watch that on MotD. Goal of Month contender 2-1 
Nasri taking on role of #Arsenal superhero from Henry in past and Cesc. He's come of age this term. Contender for Player of Year. #Arsenal
That BBC table.... #Arsenal top as #Everton equalise at #Chelsea
4 mins inj time at #Arsenal
@jasonparadise He's at Arsenal
All over. Hardly convincing. But good spirit to get job done. Handshakes all round. Time for Wenger to sort #Arsenal defence. Nasri MOM
Djourou impressive towards end. When on earth does he get his chance for #Arsenal. Someone needs to get hold of Song and instill discipline
#Fulham played well. #FFC can count themselves unlucky. #Arsenal go top. Good win
 #Arsenal boss Wenger says: '2 exceptional goals from Samir. We showed spirit, resilience and determination to win the game' 
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Koscielny concussed. 'At first we were upset game not stopped. But kos carried on.' AW praises 'dominant' Djourou
#Arsenal boss wenger insists they can win title if they can find consistency. 'We have spirit and quality'
 #Fulham #FFC boss Hughes praises #Arsenal's Nasri, saying he was difference between us. 'Crowd calling for final whistle which says a lot' 
Some donut accused me of criticising #Arsenal's c/backs because they're French. Don't care where they come from. Just how they play football
#Arsenal would walk this league if they had a top class keeper and another top centre half to partner Vermaelen. They may still do it...
 @jasonparadise With respect, were you there? It was surreal. Arsenal went top and yet fans angry at the gaps exposed.Maybe not obvious on TV

Update service resumes tomorrow. I'm at #Arsenal press conf ahead of must-win Champs Lge game v Partizan. Training then lunchtime presser
Final thought on #Arsenal after w/end. Stats on defence in Wenger era in today's Mirror make fascinating reading. In paper only BTW!
 Off to #Arsenal training and presser now. Updates l8r. PS. Don't follow southerners preaching knowledge, follow @simonbirdmirror for #nufc 
 As you were for #Arsenal training this morning, no ins and no outs. Training on one of the 2 under soil heated pitches. Very cold though! 
#Arsenal boss Wenger: 'it's simple. We have to win the game. We've put ourselves in tricky situation with our last 2 games but we must win'
#Arsenal boss Wenger said 'Ideally we want to finish top but it's out of our hands now'
#Arsenal boss Wenger said 'Our last 2 wins were important.' Rules out buying new defender.
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Koscielny will start and is Ok. Djourou out injured with thigh. But should be back at weekend. Eboue fit again
#Arsenal boss Wenger on Hughton: 'doesn't look rational. But England lost World Cup and it didn't look rational at all'
Wenger did say Koscielny will start for #Arsenal but Djourou has slight thigh injury and won't be risked. Shame. Djourou deserves chance
No Partizan journos here at #Arsenal training ground. Complacency? Arshavin up next. That should be entertaining...
Arshavin didn't disappoint. World class performance in the presser from #Arsenal star
@mcfcforum Seems as welcome as he is among some Arsenal fans. Shame in my view

#Arsenal boss Wenger hails Barca as CL 'super favourites' ://tinyurl.com/3x7yym9 Cesc and Diaby fitness boost ://tinyurl.com/2uhth84
 #Arsenal ring the changes. Clichy under the weather so Gibbs plays. Partizan worst team I've seen in Champs League. Easy win, surely...? 
Looks like another bad injury for #Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs. Turned his ankle. Stretchered off. 0-0
 Gibbs made of stern stuff. He's hobbling on. Dunno whether he'll last, but #Arsenal left back giving it a go. Now Chamakh hobbling... 
 Eboue now limbering up in typical Eboue fashion. Throwing some shapes. #Arsenal. Gibbs off, really bad luck 
Surely time for #Arsenal to bring on Theo. No urgency at all...
RvP first goal of the season for #Arsenal. It's only December. Arsenal needed that break. 1-0
Arshavin off. Had a really poor game. Theo on for #Arsenal
Theo getting stripped for #Arsenal
#Arsenal look so sluggish and sloppy. Have they forgotten what's at stake? Now left sweating on Braga...
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Sagna red card was 'very harsh.'
Theo to the rescue! #Arsenal been so poor
#Arsenal poor tonight. Scoreline flatters them. Very flat. Wake up call required before #mufc on Mon
 Think that means Barca, real Madrid, Schalke or Bayern for #Arsenal. Heavy price for finishing second in easiest Group going. Poor. 
#Arsenal boss Wenger said 'it's 50-50 as to whether we go to Germany or Spain. Barcelona are super favourites but we will take it'
#Arsenal left back Gibbs has scan tomorrow on sprained right ankle. Facing spell out. Wenger said: 'He's very down'
 #Arsenal boss Wenger said 'I was never nervous, worried, yes. We were just below our normal pace. The speed of our passing wasn't incisive'

Big test for Djourou. He's earned the chance but must take it vs #Chelsea #CFC bogeyman Drogba. 13 in 13 v #Arsenal. CFC won last 5 v Arse
 Still waiting for game to catch light. #Arsenal playing some nice stuff, #Chelsea dangerous on counter attack. Haven't we been here before? 
Now will this give #Arsenal belief? Song making a habit of scoring big goals. #Arsenal leading #Chelsea 1-0 at h/t
#Arsenal 3 up and in charge. Rarely do you see #Chelsea as poor as this and taken apart like this. Now #Arsenal must believe
Take your pick of the songs from #Arsenal fans. 'Ashley what's the score?' 'Sacked in morning' at #Chelsea boss Ancelotti. 3-1 Ivanovic
Song injured by Lampard challenge to earn #Chelsea man a booking. Will #Arsenal get twitchy now?
Diaby on for Walcott. Walcott been a menace for #Arsenal. #Chelsea will be pleased to see back of him. Maybe Wenger wants to tighten up
Fabregas comes off to standing ovation from #Arsenal fans. That mental block about his hamstring been blown away tonight.
#Arsenal been excellent. This should be - if they hold on - the win that makes them believe they can be champions. A huge win for Wenger
#Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere having pics aplenty with fans near tunnel area. And here comes AP McCoy with his BBC gong. Here's Gilberto

Big call from Wenger to make 8 changes. Genius if #Arsenal win at Wigan. If they don't Chelsea meant nothing. Gamble. Maybe injuries too.
 Wasn't that a dive? Looked it to me. #Wigan 1 up, questionable penalty against #Arsenal on first look 
Wilshere coming on for #Arsenal. Diaby off
 Wow! World class from Arshavin, amazing technique. #Arsenal 1-1 #Wigan. AA23 at his best - he needs to show that more often 
Brilliant finish by Bendtner. Supply line from AA23. That sort of finish justifies Bendtner's self belief. #Arsenal 2-1 up and playing well
Rewind to end of last season and #Arsenal's aerial weaknesses exposed again by #Wigan. A commanding centre half clears that. Here's Theo
#Arsenal should have this in bag but #Wigan shown great spirit. Thrilling finish now. 2-2
 That was handball, surely? Should have been a penalty to #Arsenal. Thomas handled Nasri free kick ala Cesc v #Spurs. Refs=inconsistent. 2-2 
 8 changes cost #Arsenal dear. 2-2 at #Wigan. In title terms, bad, bad night for Wenger whose gamble backfired. Bigger problems at #LFC... 
Get the feeling Wenger will be unhappy over 2 penalty decisions which look to have cost #Arsenal. 2-2
 No 2 games in 3 days excuses, please. It's what we do in England and we love it. #Arsenal blown big chance, albeit 2 bad decisions cost dear 
 What is it about high balls at #Wigan that #Arsenal don't like? After last season, still no lessons learnt

Doing Talksport paper review Weds morning on @sportsbreakfast from 7am. Lots of #Arsenal #AFC v #MCFC chat and all the stories in papers
Off to Emirates for #AFC v #MCFC. Fancy #Arsenal 2-1 win which is probably great news for City as I'm the worst pundit ever. Huge for both
 #Arsenal in charge, bossing the game but for all their chances and dominance, #MCFC remain defiant and are defending well. Cracking game 0-0 
 Will #Arsenal end up ruing missed chances? #AFC have bossed it, Walcott has been lively and #MCFC lucky to be on level terms. 0-0 h/t 
#Arsenal need to go more direct and gamble on Chamakh. They will rue this game if they don't take 3 points. #MCFC slightly better 2nd half
 #Arsenal held, #mcfc jeered off with 'boring, boring City' and 'what a waste of money.' But missed chances cost dear for Wenger. 
#Arsenal boss Wenger says he is 'not surprised' at City's approach. 'I feel we had the performance but not the result.'

 #Arsenal striker Bendtner, who claims to be worthy of starting place when fit every week, slashes great chance wide. #takearealitycheck

 Great to see John Hartson at #Arsenal today. What a top bloke. Relived some Arsenal, Wimbledon and West Ham memories... Different class.

That's why short deal or loan (Upson or other) would be option to solve injury crisis. Shame though. Great chance for #Arsenal to win league
 But remember #Arsenal lost 3 c/bs in summer (Sol, Silvestre, Senderos) and bought 2 (SS, Kos). Time to spend those profits if u wanna win 
 Oh yes, my mistake. Gallas, too. #Arsenal lost 4 defenders - and 2 in. Anyone got a calculator? Big ticket prices, profits, small signings. 
Just been pointed out to me that #Arsenal missing creativity with Nasri and Arshavin missing. One was rested. The other took a rest. Poor.
#SAFC #Sunderland want #whufc defender Upson as #Arsenal only want cheap solution before bigger buy in summer: ://tinyurl.com/4zlu9sz

#Arsenal m/f Wilshere told me another nice line (didn't survive sub's knife) that he still hasn't met Beckham properly but wants to asap
 Closest to meeting was when Beckham trained at #Arsenal couple of yrs ago. Wilshere then in ressies:   I saw him, thought: 'wow.'   #grounded 
Won't be easy for #Arsenal despite the chaos at #whufc. But Wenger expecting reaction from his players after Ipswich defeat.
 Parker injured for #whufc. Theo, RvP and Nasri start for #Arsenal. Bendtner and AA23 dropped to bench 
 Who is man of match? Frankly, you could choose one of several from #Arsenal. Movement and passing superb. A few shockers from #whufc 
Got lots of different suggestions for MoM but RvP pen (plus assist and goal) swings it for me. #Arsenal. As for #whufc pantomime villain...
Arshavin ran to corner flag and back to warm up for #Arsenal. More effort than he put in at Ipswich...
 #Arsenal superb, brilliant win. Fans chant to #whufc boss Grant has changed from 'sacked in the morning' to 'sacked in a minute.' Cruel. 
 #Arsenal travelling fans always noisy, supportive and superb. #whufc fans deserve much better. Green gets sponsors' man of match. Classic! 
 TV, radio quiet on Grant today, having said #whufc boss would be gone after #Arsenal game. Funny how they don't rubbish their own reports... 
 We've known for ages that he's coming and is good, but Szczesny impresses more with every game. Presence. Can he be no1 at 20? Yes. #arsenal 
 #Arsenal And seems like a nice chap, too. Szczesny stopped for a chat yesterday after the game and had some banter recently. #wojciechforPM

 Farewell Starbucks, my loyal friend. Home to watch #Leeds v #Arsenal with champagne. Lovely. 
Enjoyed u standing up for #Arsenal. But my Samba story said £6m. Surely not even Wenger could offer £5m. And then again... @markpougatch

#Arsenal's biggest threat today is fatigue. Need to keep up title charge v Wigan with 2 big cup games to follow. Carling Cup huge IMO
 Off to Emirates early to watch #wwfc v #lfc. Then surely an #Arsenal win? But Wigan upset #AFC recently... And no, I'm not doing predictions

#Arsenal midfielder Denilson in programme denying he even spoke about Cesc. Shame it's on TV. An insult to everyone's intelligence
 Wenger doesn't understand #Arsenal fans at times. If he gambles on not buying, then doesn't win anything because of injuries, hell to pay 
Still think there's chance of signing for #Arsenal. Must buy. Samba darn cheaper than Cahill. BTW All of Denilson interview on tape...
Beckham in stands at #Arsenal with his son. Is he wearing #Arsenal scarf? Hughton here too
Unbelievable save by Al Habsi from RvP. How #Arsenal are not ahead is a mystery. Save of the season! 0-0
Brilliant goal and richly deserved. Superb finish by RvP for #Arsenal 1-0. Onside and beautiful through ball by Song
Fabregas brings another unbelievable save from Al Habsi and the #Arsenal captain also denied wonder goal by great Wigan defending
 Theo showed incredible pace there but squared it to Cesc rather than shoot. Why, oh why? He's playing so well, have confidence. #Arsenal 1-0 
Beautiful goal by RvP (6 in 8) to make it 2-0 to #Arsenal. Sensational finish from Fabregas through ball. Impressive morale boosting display
 #Arsenal striker RvP blasts penalty over the bar after Gary Caldwell upends Fabregas. Another great ball by Song. Song is, er, unsung hero.. 
Hat trick hero RvP scores and is subbed for his trouble. More than made up for his penalty miss. Great finish. #Arsenal 3-0
 Denilson on for Fabregas, 87. But in the nicest possible way obviously. No offence meant, none taken. #Arsenal in cruise control. 
All over. Great win for #Arsenal. Proves they can really push all the way for the Prem title. #Wigan are gonna struggle to stay up. Big time
#Arsenal boss Wenger: 'RvP is always no1 penalty taker and what happened today will not change that'

Wonder whether Beckham will become an #Arsenal fan..? Bet his boy loved it. Mind you. he couldn't really admit it while training at #thfc...
 Terrific performances in #Arsenal victory. RvP hat trick traditionally wins match ball, Cesc superb but don't forget Song. Just gets better

 Frantic day of house stuff, then long run with FA Cup on my radio. Bye all my Twitter chums. Catch up tomorrow for #Arsenal v #Huddersfield 
 #Arsenal comfortable start, Almunia not tested yet and Arshavin trying hard, hit a post. Huddersfield playing well, doing themselves proud 
#Arsenal striker Bendtner mocked after missing his kick - then less than a minute later scores and cocks his ear to Huddersfield fans 1-0
You can't knock Bendtner for never giving up even if his goal for #Arsenal took deflection. Great chance for #Huddersfield but Lee misses
#Arsenal nightmare. Nasri has pulled up. Hamstring? Coming off
Such a blow for #Arsenal. Lee Dixon said on 5Live that a player immediately knows how bad a hamstring is and thought Nasri feared worst.
#Arsenal gone flat while ruing Nasri. Pilkington headed wide great chance for #Huddersfield
 #Arsenal welcome back Sqillaci - then he gets s/off. No arguments. It does prove why Wenger must strengthen squad. Suspensions, injuries 
Arshavin working hard for #Arsenal - great to see. Dangerous going forward then great tackle in his own penalty box. That's more like it!
#Huddersfield having best spell of game. Lee forces terrific save from #Arsenal keeper Almunia. Crucial 10 minutes
That's been coming. #Huddersfield striker Lee beats #Arsenal's Diaby in the air. Awful defending. Upset on cars so send on Cesc

#Arsenal boss Wenger did make one cheeky transfer bid - to re-sign Lee Dixon. Wenger joked after picking him out at back of press conf room
Did I miss anything on my Twitter break? Looking at my Daily Mirror transfer graphic. What do Arsenal and Wigan have in common? No signings
Off to #Arsenal v #Everton later. Then Birmingham v Man City 2morrow. Anyone know how to get beyond the M25? Will they understand my accent?
@lulunix No. Only Arsenal's new 'signings' need one of those...
Thanks for replies. Graphic was wrong. Wigan got Sammom. Arsenal got no one. And Miyaichi has gone from Japanese High School to Feyenoord
RvP has just pulled two unbelievable pieces of skill. First a back heel which Cesc put wide then awesome drag back. #EFC evens with #Arsenal
 Blimey, who needs Torres? #CFC raining goals at #SAFC. That rule - if right - is an ass for #Arsenal. But no-one argue #EFC playing well 
 So-called 'experts' now Google-ing offside rule. Even if it's right, it's got to be wrong. Wenger berating 4th official. #Arsenal 0 #EFC 1 
#EFC always dangerous away from home. #Arsenal understandably frustrated with the ref. But they need to get back their discipline - quick
 Boos at half time. Referee Lee Mason is greeted by chants of 'cheat, cheat.' And worse. #Arsenal losing their heads. #EFC benefitting. 0-1 
Here comes Bendtner. Wilshere sacrificed. Referee Lee Mason has regained a little control. Arsenal need to dig deep. #EFC doing well
Carbon copy! Arshavin looked to be in offside position but Rodwell headed the ball - and #Arsenal equalise. 1-1. Big 20 minutes
If #Arsenal come from behind to win this it may just make their season. Shows their spirit. #EFC are very good away from home though...
What a fightback from #Arsenal. Koscielny scores 2-1. This is how titles are won. #neversaydiespirit. #EFC still in this though.
 Don't want to tempt fate, but... This could be a defining victory for #Arsenal. Great spirit, comeback, #EFC tough nut to crack 
All over. Season defining moment for #Arsenal. Could have dropped their heads but didn't. Great spirit. #EFC very unlucky - sorry Dunny.
Here's a curious one. #CFC big spending has shortened #Arsenal's title odds. Why? Because Chelsea with their improved team play #mufc twice
 #Arsenal boss Wenger:   For me the goal was offside. If someone can demonstrate to me that it was mathematically not, I’ll accept that.   
 #Arsenal boss Wenger:   I’m happy because spirit is maybe the aspect of the team that’s been questioned the most. Been v convincing recently   
 Song injured for #Arsenal. Couldn't walk. Walcott ankle knock. Nasri 21 days out, says Wenger 
#Arsenal boss Wenger hits back claiming he spoke to ref Mason and Cesc didn't.
#Arsenal boss Wenger also digs out #CFC over their spending spree. Cold war resumes...

Always amusing to see Wenger welcomed into the Emirates with a hug and handshake from Gunnersaurus. #Arsenal play strongest line up vs #WWFC
Decent start by #WWFC who must take confidence from some big scalps. #Arsenal have put out first XI but Barca must be on their minds...
 Not quite as spectacular, but more important. RvP with stunning right - yes, right - foot volley. #Arsenal 1-0. Holding nerve, playing well 
 #Arsenal in total control, playing with style and confidence. AA23 misses sitter. 1-0 
 Bit of a mystery how #Arsenal aren't further ahead, playing well and creating chances. Theo and Cesc go close. #WWFC still in at 1-0 though 
Loved Djourou's Cruyff turn. Not sure about his challenge though - #WWFC pen appeals. #Arsenal should be further ahead but Wolves in this
 #Arsenal 1-0 up at half time. Deservedly so, could be further ahead. #WWFC keeper Hennessey playing a blinder. But Wolves still bang in it 
 Lovely #Arsenal goal. Beautiful Cesc pass, Theo run, RvP finish. Home and hosed now, surely? Maybe dangerous to assume after last Sat...2-0 
RvP comes off to brilliant reception - and deservedly so. He's given #Arsenal an extra gear of late. Bendtner and Chamakh on (AA23 also off)
 Wilshere off, replaced by Denilson. Wilshere has done well for #Arsenal today. Always tough test after midweek international - but he passed 
 Especially for a few of my lovely followers... #WWFC still in this, you know... #Arsenal in control, ref having poor game IMO. 2-0 
 Bendtner has played wide (both sides) since coming on. Nice movement, close control. There's so much more in him to be unlocked. #Arsenal 
 All over at #Arsenal. Wenger boys put psychological issues to bed. Good performance, great win. #WWFC not as competitive as usual. 2-0 f/t

Wenger was a man with a point to prove yesterday. Talking about showing 'the real #Arsenal this year.' Out to gain revenge on #Barcelona
 Off to Emirates. Cannot wait for #Arsenal v #Barcelona. Classic awaits, office banking on it, plenty of coverage again 
 The great and the good in #Arsenal press room. Vieira, Smith, Dixon and, er, Sam Allardyce... 
Wenger on bigscreen: 'I want a good performance from my team and I'm sure we will get it.' #Arsenal players get gr8 reception as they run in
 #Arsenal Alex Song has grown his hair, bleached it again and his beard. Looks even more like King Neptune. Two guys in Song wigs nr p/box 
This is the one... #Arsenal #Barca get ready. Hold onto your hats... Shame I forgot mine...
 Walcott unleashes turbo jets for first time and, sure enough, no-one can get close to him. #Arsenal started well, so different to last year 
Good and bad parts of Szczesny's game. Poor kick then Barca chance and the #Arsenal keeper stood up brilliantly to make Messi miss.0-0 tense
 Wenger clearly mouthing: 'it was two metres offside.' Sadly for #Arsenal, TV replay shows that Villa onside. Away goal. Heads up AFC. 0-1 
#Barcelona in the groove. #Arsenal must follow Wilshere's advice and get in their faces.. Made such a good start and need to get going again
Arshavin getting stripped off. Bendtner looking hopefully to the bench. Nasri off for #Arsenal?
Offside? Messi side netting anyway. Keita replacing Villa as Barca look to consolidate. Song off for Arshavin as #Arsenal go for jugular
Here comes Bendtner. Getting stripped for #Arsenal. 0-1
Brilliant goal by RvP to give #Arsenal real hope. Valdes howler at his near post. 1-1.
Arshavin completes incredible late fight back to give #Arsenal real hope of overcoming mighty Barcelona. 2-1. Amazing atmosphere now

Miquel involved today as #Arsenal ring changes. Wow. It's high up here!
They say the FA Cup is a great leveller... It is when #Arsenal put Miquel alongside Squillaci in central defence with Almunia in goal

 Wow. What a cup draw. The FA Cup has got its magic back. #mufc v #Orient. Er, I mean, #Arsenal. Great incentive to win here. 
#Arsenal started with not enough urgency. Chamakh half hearted effort sums up their attitude. #Orient making Squillaci nervous... 0-0
 Dawson playing v well for #Orient, breaking it up in midfield. #Arsenal wasting possession. Song, Denilson and Rosicky need to start bossing 
 Miquel definitely the pick of the 2 centre halves, done OK so far. #Orient done themselves proud so far, #Arsenal improving 
 Keown offering cracking insight, in particular on #Arsenal duo Rosicky, Bendtner. Questioning their personal desire. Nasri, Cesc warming up 
Brilliant. Always likely to tempt fate Bendtner and Rosicky team up 1-0 #Arsenal. Orient been superb so far. How will they react?
#Orient have dug in and responded so well. #Arsenal not won it yet. 0-1
 #Orient rewarded for persistence. 1-1. Another game a nightmare for #Arsenal, a dream for Barry Hearn. 4 mins added

Nice way to answer some critics (including me) as Squillaci puts #Arsenal ahead. 1-0. #AFC started really well.
Seriously bad news here for #Arsenal as Cesc is struggling. Arshavin stripped and ready to come on.
Terrible news for #Arsenal as Fabregas comes off. Looked like a knee problem. Just days ahead of Cup final. Here's AA23
The whole place has been rather dumbstruck by Cesc injury. #Stoke went close through Carew but #Arsenal keeper Szczesny made great save 1-0
 #Arsenal started quickly, deserved Squillaci lead 1-0. Cesc injury taken wind out of their sails. #Stoke Carew forced top save from Szczesny 
#Arsenal suffer another major injury blow as Walcott stretchered off. Winning but at a price and #Stoke still in it. 1-0
Victory but at what cost to #Arsenal? Nasty challenges in there and Wenger left licking his wounds. #Stoke made fight of it 2nd half.1-0 f/t
 Double blow for #Arsenal. Theo sprained ankle, misses final. Cesc hamstring assessed Thurs 
Bruising for #Arsenal but Wenger had no complaints and was smiling rather than grimacing. Wenger praised #Stoke 'spirit and intelligence'

 Family today so go to MirrorFootball site or old thing called our 'newspaper' for #Arsenal preview inc Wenger, Cesc, Sagna wedding stories 
Talk in press room that #bcfc go 4-4-2 with Zigic and Martins. Martins famously destroyed #Arsenal a few years back while at Inter
 #Arsenal selection a little more straight forward, surely Bendtner. Football League very happy with Wembley pitch, looking good 
Teams arrived at Wembley. Cesc and Theo very much part of the #Arsenal set-up. Nice touch for the injured players
I think Rosicky over Bendtner is mistake - and not just because of my piece on NB52 in the Wembley programme. NB more physical for #Arsenal
People saying tracksuits shows lack of class.When #Arsenal lost at Wembley years back under GG they were accused of being arrogant in suits!
 Nasri wide right, Rosicky in central role, AA23 wide for #Arsenal. Wembley neutral stadium, neutral PA announcer, hired Old Trafford's! 
 Very even first ten minutes. #Arsenal had let off, Foster looked assured for #BCFC and #AFC went close through AA23 after finding rhythm 
 When you produce that sort of skill, maybe it entitles you to shoot, but Nasri bit greedy there. Wilshere playing well for #Arsenal. 
 God reading of the game by Koscielny. #Arsenal not playing particularly well, #BCFC playing well - looking solid, hassling and harrying. 0-0 
 Terrific defending by Jiranek to stop RvP in his tracks. #BCFC playing well. #Arsenal need to get passing game going, Rosicky v quiet 
 #BCFC take lead - and that man Zigic again. 1-0. 28 gone. They've played really well. #Arsenal look nervy, that 6 year wait weighing heavy 
Djourou has just made two outstanding defensive blocks. #BCFC in the zone. #Arsenal clinging on a bit. Nasty challenge by Koscielny there
#Arsenal level. Wilshere hit bar then RvP led by example to make it 1-1. AA23 did brilliantly. #BCFC will b annoyed Bowyer off pitch at time
#Arsenal will be the happier team to go in at half time simply because #BCFC have played better and yet the score is 1-1. Good game.
 The drama keeps on coming. Fahey should score, but hits the post. #BCFC continue to play well. But #Arsenal looking better. Tense 1-1 
And that must be RvP struggling after his goal. Here comes Bendtner. He can provide new threat for #Arsenal
#Arsenal going for jugular with Chamakh getting stripped off. Wenger looking to exploit #BCFC at the back
 #BCFC look dead on their feet, all #Arsenal now. McLeish has so many injured players on that he doesn't know where to start... 
 #BCFC have fought so hard for this. Great spirit. The #Arsenal wait goes on. Terrific Carling Cup final. #BCFC go wild, #Arsenal broken 
#Arsenal shell shocked and now they will need all their mental strength to make sure the other trophies don't slip away in the hangover
Wenger claimed number of games took toll on #Arsenal. But insists they will bounce back. Big mental test now.
 #Arsenal Wilshere in tears at end. He looked really good first half but tiredness too its toll. That, and the mental blow, is big danger 
 For those looking to start a Twitter row, Wilshere crying not a negative. If #Arsenal had 11 with his spirit then they'd bounce right back

 @Shane_arsenal You're missing the point. If gaining bulk is performance enhancing, isn't losing weight if it makes u faster? 
Ramsey got great reception at #Arsenal when name read out. Kicked off early and #SAFC started brightly. #AFC nervy. 0-0
 #Arsenal started very nervously. Gonna be an awkward afternoon for Wenger. Bit better spell now, but #SAFC can make it tricky 
 And the ball goes up between Koscielny and Szczesny, the Emirates holds its breath... Thankfully for #Arsenal, this time Kos heads back. 0-0 
Bendtner overhead kick saved by Mignolet for #SAFC. Anywhere else in the goal and #Arsenal lead. Nasri giving everything - as usual. 0-0
Bendtner close again for #Arsenal. NB52 shot saved by #SAFC keeper Mignolet. 0-0. Arsenal not playing at their best but doing better
 Lots of exhaling and 'ooooh, tough game' going on in #Arsenal press room at h/t. Break improved by Depeche Mode's Just Can't Get Enough 
Djourou the pick of #Arsenal's defenders again today. #SAFC bang in this. Playing well. Chamakh warming up intensely. Henderson booked
Ramsey getting great reception whenever he comes out for a trot and warm up. #Arsenal need injection of attacking threat here. 0-0 nervy
 And to prove I'm a tactical genius (please note that was a joke), here comes Chamakh for #Arsenal... 
Welbeck on for #SAFC as Bruce goes for the jugular. Now they've got real pace and threat on the counter. #Arsenal can't over commit
Here comes Rosicky as #Arsenal look to reshuffle again. No thoughts of a rest for #Barcelona for any of the big guns though... F/kick here
Best chance yet and Chamakh hits the BAR for #Arsenal
Chamakh has made a big difference since coming on but should have scored rather than hit the bar from Wilshere's sublime cross #Arsenal
Wenger complains bitterly - and no wonder! TV replay shows even clearer that Bramble pushes AA23. Stone wall pen turned down for #Arsenal
TV replay shows Arshavin was ONSIDE. Think #Arsenal hard done by having that disallowed.
4 mins added time. Titles are won and lost on days like this. Pivotal weekend and #Arsenal need all three points. Hold onto your hats!

 #Barcelona not in top gear yet. Not as fluid, threatening or as menacing as first leg. Hope for #Arsenal 
 Awful time to concede, awful defending, brilliant play by Messi. Sensational improvisation. #Arsenal must regain composure asap 1-0 h/t 
 #Arsenal always knew they'd have to score... Wenger must look to change sooner rather than later, particularly in midfield 
Bad night for #Arsenal in Nou Camp. #Barca been sensational and RvP's crazy red card just made things even harder. Shown great spirit
 Some brave performances from #Arsenal players out there. Almunia, Koscielny, Wilshere and they've never given up. A year on and gap closer 
But ultimately #Barca too hot to handle - especially with backs to the wall and ten men. Crucial #Arsenal recover for Old Trafford on Sat

 Sam Allardyce, the man who oversaw Blackburn's 7-1 defeat at Man United, in the ESPN studio at Arsenal to offer his expert opinion. 
 Apparently u cant joke about Arsenal. The Wilshere comment was a joke. It prompted foul mouth reply, Duly blocked. Get a sense of humour 
Arshavin track back and brilliant block deep in his own half draws great applause from #Arsenal fans. Ability with attitude = world class
Keeper Robinson is Blackburn's dead ball expert. Launched one for N'Zonzi who nodded just wide. Almunia is #Arsenal's calamity expert. #AFC
Why are there so many empty seats at the Emirates today? #Arsenal going for the title and yet people stay away. Defies belief.
 60,087 the official attendance. The real attendance much lower. #Arsenal 
This is astonishing. I could have sworn that #Arsenal were still in the title race but the Emirates is as flat as a pancake.
Titles won and lost through never say die spirit. #mufc showed bucketloads today. #Arsenal didn't. Boos at the end. Surely #mufc title now.

 @ErolStreet Yes, everyone killed him while he was the best manager in Arsenal's history, a media darling, winning everything before him. 
PFA nominations. #Arsenal's Wilshere has eclipsed Nasri in main contenders and should be in both IMO. Modric should also be ahead of Bale.

Two great finishes by Bent for #AVFC 0-2. #Arsenal's end of season collapse going from bad to worse. Lap of appreciation may be interesting
End of season collapse become an embarrassment for #Arsenal. Got to question the professionalism of some of these players who have given up.
Finally a response from #Arsenal. Surely a pen after Dunne challenge on Ramsey. Wenger and Rice in technical area. Not happy.
 #Arsenal's last home game of season. Really poor so far. Lap of 'appreciation' will be a hard sell, let alone big season ticket price rises 
 #Arsenal fans at Clock End singing their hearts out. Major credit. Some players responding well, RvP in particular. #AVFC defending well 0-2 
 #Arsenal booed off at half time. Will the players ever get the message? Villa fans been loud, proud and enjoying superb first half. 0-2 Bent 
Here comes Chamakh for #Arsenal
Song moves into central defence. Arsenal go 4-4-2 with RvP and Chamakh up front. Desperate measure dor desperate times. 0-2
#Arsenal begun the 2nd half with no urgency. Have they forgotten they're losing 0-2? Villa looking very comfortable right now.
Arshavin off in the 62nd minute. I'm a huge fan of Arshavin's. Great talent. But he could have been subbed 61 mins ago. #Arsenal
 Attendance at #Arsenal decalred at 60,063. Aggregate for season: 1,848617. So that was just over a million for season. 
#Arsenal fans chanting: '6 per cent you're having a laugh.' Plenty of anger now. Lap of appreciation will be interesting.
 Villa fans really enjoying their afternoon. Making a huge noise. Arsenal fans leaving en masse. Not waiting for lap of appreciation? Er, no. 
Stadium emptying out. Be amazed if it will be anywhere near half full for the now laughable 'lap of appreciation' for #Arsenal.
Finally. #Arsenal get one back. Ref been so poor that I half expected him to disallow it. But he is not to blame for all the faults today.
Ah well. Villa fans can show their appreciation to #Arsenal's players for a gutless performance which gifted them three points.
The fans are chanting: 'Arsenal we love you.' It shouldn't be the fans clapping but the players. Embarrassing walk. The players owe fans.
 Van Persie embraced #Arsenal's lap of appreciation. Thanked fans, clapped them and he deserves praise for his season. But bad day for #AFC 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger down, but paid tribute to fans after lap of appreciation and now fears CL play-off with #mcfc breathing down necks

 Very, very windy at the Cottage. Wenger joking pre-match that it's perfect conditions for football to be played on the floor. #Arsenal 
 Good to see #Arsenal lining up with two conventional strikers, lends itself to 4-4-2. Fulham have Senderos at the back. Surely some goals... 
 #Arsenal start as 4-4-2 with Chamakh and RvP up front. Ramsey on the right, Diaby and Wilshere central and Nasri left. 
Say it every time but #Arsenal's away support always noisy and different class. Totally different to at the Emirates. Love Craven Cottage
 #Fulham lead #Arsenal. Awful defending as #AFC can't keep a line, Djourou plays Zamora onside and Sidwell fires home cross. 1-0. 
 Wow. #Arsenal level. fabulous finish by RvP. Great goal, what form he's in. 1-1 
Great clearance by Vermaelen as Murphy seemed certain to score.Fulham fan headed ball back into play from stands - Arsenal shud sign him up!
Carling Cup a costly competition. Both Arsenal and Birmingham saw their seasons end that day. Birmingham won it but little consolation.
 #Arsenal boss Wenger pays tribute to 'fantastic' away support - but warns may not spend big, laments bad defending and poor end to campaign 
#Arsenal boss Wenger says no official verdict on Wilshere but he's made his plea to FA. He won't be in when u-21 squad announced tomorrow
 We can all add some to #Arsenal's out list like Vela, Rosicky etc. But who would take Rosicky on his deal without pay off? Big prob for all

Chief exec Ivan Gazidis pledges #Arsenal 'will still be active' in this window and have 'substantial' funds. Big read: ://tinyurl.com/3n88u5c 
Gazidis also made it crystal clear that #Arsenal have money to spend - and want to spend it. I think c/half up next. He also listens to fans
Local derbies the subject of the @BTLifesapitch podcast. #Arsenal vs #Tottenham is my favourite derby. What's yours? ://ow.ly/5HVlv 
Who is going to be first with 'that's closest #Arsenal will get to Premier League Trophy...?' ://twitpic.com/5wxtve
 Hong Kong. Morning! Lots of #Arsenal: Mata, Cesc, Jagielka, Bendtner ://tinyurl.com/3ftz9tu If all get done, #AFC will be in great shape 
 Had superb day at #Arsenal. Took part in fun Junior Gunners event, met some great fans and @JackWilshere was superb in their Q&A afterwards 
On the @BTLifesapitch podcast - #Arsenal must sign a new centre half: ://ow.ly/5VaAi  #afc I'm with @Arsenalhou on this one...
 Title heavyweights spending big with big names. Ah well, at least Arsenal have snapped up Costa Rican striker Joel Campbell for 900k 
 For the record, my personal view is I'm sure Oxlade-Chamberlain will be a great success. Arsenal also need a centre half. 
Delighted to be taking part in first of the season and new-look #Arsenal Fans' Forum this week: ://tinyurl.com/3o6jjw6  Plenty to chat about!
Cesc's Barca deal edging closer but #Arsenal hold out for a bit more: ://tinyurl.com/3ly6a5v And who should they spend the money on?
 My weekly web column: #Arsenal's prospects for 2011/12, Wenger and why Wilshere will be key man post Fabregas: ://tinyurl.com/3wejxsd 
 @HirooNakamura I think it will get done but it wasn't done yesterday. Rightly, Arsenal have been trying to broker a better (fair) deal... 
 My column on #Arsenal's prospects for 2011/12. Cesc, Nasri set to go, Wilshere main man and Wenger: ://tinyurl.com/3wejxsd  How will #AFC fare? 
#Arsenal boss Wenger wants Cesc and Nasri resolved: ://tinyurl.com/3wogw4u And who/what next for Wenger: ://tinyurl.com/3skzv54 #AFC
 #Arsenal are in market for major new signings, several centre halves on their hit list as they look for one possibly two, Mata, Jadson... 
 And in better news... Nearly all of #Arsenal's injury doubts (RvP, TV5, Gibbs, AA23 etc fit for SAT). Wilshere OUT and struggling for Tues 
First #Arsenal ATVO Fans' Forum of season should be interesting... Await views with interest...
@Arsenalman2011 Unfollow then. Reporting on 2 of Arsenal's best players going clearly isn't news in your eyes
@LeGrove Yes! Interviewed him for the Arsenal mag. Hardly died in the wool but he reckons Joel Campnell will be a WMD (is the bomb)
@Cfcaway had to show u this>> @ls_1983 may have been clipped? Get off the fucking fence! Just admit you don't like arsenal at all
I think #Arsenal have behaved with dignity and as well as possible over Cesc saga. Can that be said of the other 2 parties involved?
 Please: No more people saying should have sorted it ages ago. That's Barca's fault, their dithering and poor behaviour. Not down to Arsenal 
 #Arsenal boss Wenger wishes Cesc well, says club will carry on and still wants Nasri to stay 
Cesc: 'I'm an Arsenal fan.' Watch out #Barca. Does this mean that he'll want to come back to #AFC next summer? #anothersaga
Fancy another Cesc saga? #Arsenal get first refusal on Fabregas as they drive hard bargain to get £40m deal: ://tinyurl.com/3qdcpq4 
 #Arsenal buy back option on Fabregas is fixed price for what they sold him for. At £40m, various add ons and clauses, good business.

Delighted to take part in the Gooner Podcast - what does the summer now hold for #Arsenal? ://tinyurl.com/3vmzelx  #afc
 #Arsenal have scored 21 goals, conceded 2 in 8 play off games in the Champs League. They have the pedigree and experience to see off Udinese 
 Er, never in doubt... Great response from Walcott, superb display by Szczesny. #Arsenal edge it 1-0. Sagna good, too. Think they'll go thru 
 After horrible few weeks, #Arsenal fans at Emirates were different class tonight. Supportive from first to last, just what was needed. #afc 
Media turning on Wenger? Do me a favour. My column on #Arsenal and how the #AFC boss is viewed by the press: ://tinyurl.com/3db3doq 
@11Gunz @1979gooner @mjl Do you know my job? Are you my boss? No. We largely send one man to one club. That's why i do a lot of Arsenal.
 @mjl @11gunz @1979gooner Googled Man United and Mirror Sport: About 38,300,000 results. Googled Arsenal and Mirror Sport: 19,100,000. Bang. 
 Great night at Saatchi Gallery celebrating 125 years of #Arsenal. Great exhibition, fantastic film, good company. 
 I've got a super saver account. Wonder if Arsenal have a separate Man City account. Ade, Kolo, Clichy, Nasri. Funds still largely untouched. 
 #AFC Rosicky rested because he is carrying niggle, rest of injuries not looking good either for #Arsenal 
Mirror columnist Mark Lawrenson on why fixing Arsenal is easy - and he runs rule over the centre half contenders: ://tinyurl.com/3v5u4rp 
Off to Italy today. So much riding on Udinese v #Arsenal. I think #afc will scrape through. Will be interesting couple of days for Wenger...
@Arsenal_Away I don't think he'll play
 Whether or not Nasri in squad, if you go through the potential #Arsenal line up at Udinese then it should be strong enough. Belief the issue 
#Arsenal boss Wenger due to speak to us shortly at Luton airport before flying. Very shortly...
#Arsenal boss Wenger says Wilshere has had setback on injury. Rosicky fit
#Arsenal boss Wenger says 'summer v difficult as Nasri and Cesc in permanent transfer negotiarions. Sad to lose 2 great players'
UEFA statement at 7.30pm. Will UEFA do Wenger a favour? They've not been on great terms lately... So hot here in Udi. Fancy Arsenal tonight.
Small band of #AFC fans have made the trip to Udinese. The away fans are never quiet or lacking in passion wherever they follow Arsenal.
 ..,.including at St James's Park - and maybe that's the problem! Arsenal to go through (hope that doesn't jinx things!) 
 Di Natale by far and away Udinese's best player. 1-0 Udinese, 40 gone. Now there's a test for Arsenal... 
Any pundit who tells you Arsenal haven't solved their keeper problem doesn't know their onions. Szczesny will be among best in world. #afc
 Great night for #afc. Good performances - Gervinho, Szczesny, RvP, Jenkinson to name but a few. #Arsenal into Thurs draw 
Beggars belief that the Nasri quotes which have so upset Arsenal fans come from the official Man City website. Incredible.
 Plenty of reaction to #afc win in Udine in Mirror. Plus hearing Bolton have knocked back an Arsenal bid for Cahill, holding out for 17m 
@talkSPORTDrive Carried away?! It was make or break. They made it. Not carried away. Season now starts for Arsenal.
 Here's my web column on #Arsenal: bit.ly/qLknph After the success in Udinese, here's my take on what #afc need now... 
 #Arsenal, as revealed in today's Mirror, have rock bottom bid for Cahill rejected. Happy to charge sky high prices though. Financial doping? 
Clubs play poker. But didn't Arsenal cry foul over low bids on Cesc? Cahill exactly what Arsenal need. So hope #afc haven't alienated #bwfc
At #Arsenal training ground ready and waiting for #afc boss Wenger. Good issues. Be ineresting today...
 @Arsenal_myview No, I presented both cases in paper this morning. Bolton claiming it, Arsenal denying it. U decide. 
@1886_DialSquare It's all over the back pages! U read it as reporting as it's Bolton but would see it as criticism if it were Arsenal!
Follow the excellent @JamieDalton82 for a few updates on Arsenal interest in Park Chu Young...
@Blackburngeorge I'll bet you a pint next time you come to Arsenal. How about that?
A superb gesture by #Arsenal #afc: ://tinyurl.com/3r883zx 
@ColinBoucher Def not going to Arsenal mate. Been too busy for Twitter today. Saving it for paper. Staggered how some find time!
Arteta to the wire... #Arsenal still hoping...
#efc boss Moyes signals Arteta to #afc is on. 'Mikel informed me he wanted to join arsenal. I'm disappointed to lose him.'
 #Arsenal all agreed with Arteta, #efc. Still waiting on formalities but 99pc it'll be OK. I think #afc have turned around the window today. 
@gibfootballshow No hard feelings. People allowed to bid. And I did tell you Arsenal go low (Cahill..!) Good window in end for #afc. Cheers!
On Talksport shortly talking #afc transfers. Good day for Arsenal in my opinion. Arteta top quality.
 Arteta volunteered to take pay cut to force through move to #afc. Signs four year deal, final piece for Arsenal: ://tinyurl.com/3rk2rco  #efc 
Congrats Mo Farah. Amazing race. Shows he's world class. Big Arsenal fan. Wenger wrote good luck letter to him during Europeans last year

 Expert analysis in various papers ahead of Arsenal v Swansea. Bruce Rioch, Alan Curtis and, er, Jean-Paul Sartre. Pseud's corner awaits 
Szczesny voted Arsenal Player of the Month despite letting in 10 in league. And was deserved winner. Says much about season so far
Bit of luck and skill gets Arsenal season going. Terrible Swansea defensive mix up but brilliant finish by Arshavin. 1-0 #afc.
 Shame as Swansea had played really well up to then. Been dangerous, too. Arteta, Mertesacker and Szczesny done well for Arsenal. 1-0 #afc 
 Crowd at Arsenal is 60,087. Seems a bit generous... 
 Sinclair free kick hit the bar for Swansea. Visitors definitely still in this. 1-0 #afc. Arsenal played OK, but still not fully convincing 
Here comes Yossi for Arsenal
 Here comes Coquelin for #Arsenal, replacing Frimpong. Still 1-0. Swansea still in it. Gonna be tense finale. Swans played so well today. 
Arsenal were hanging on there - and then waste counter attack chance. Tense! Stoppage time
Gibbs forces save on the break. Exciting. But Arsenal wouldn't want to be clinging on against Swansea... They've been great. 1-0 #afc
And still fans leave early. How could you leave not knowing if you've team have won?! Now they have. Arsenal edge it 1-0. Credit Swans
Mo Farah having his pic taken with #Arsenal crest. Hope his mate's white shoes don't ruin the pic.
 @FilipEvans @CavemanJae I was at Arsenal and Attwell got one decision so wrong it was embarrassing. Was it bias? No, just a mistake. 
 Our brilliant artists (best in Fleet St but I'm biased) have put together fun Arsenal page in Mirror, I'm told. Do yourselves a favour.. 
@charliewyett in Bild under headline: Fur Arsene war's bei Arsenal noch nie so schwer! ://twitpic.com/6kc3up 
 For those asking, the Arsenal coverage in the pull out of today's paper 
@Goonernl Thanks for reply. I mentioned both economics and state of the nation at Arsenal. Which do u think is bigger influence?
 Arsenal exceptional 1st half. Could and probably should be further ahead. New players/team bedding in. Song, Ramsey still superb #afc 
#THFC started brilliantly. #LFC look vulnerable. Spurs fans taunting: 'are you Arsenal in disguise?' Dalglish fury at disallowed effort. 1-0
Mark Clattenburg in charge of Arsenal #afc v Bolton. Kevin Friend in charge at Liverpool. Don't think he'll be any friend of Kenny's...
Wenger also paid warm tribute to #afc fans for support at Blackburn - and in general. Arsenal away support always superb.
Also check out what Wenger says about the #afc fans in the pieces. Warm praise for the supporters and their backing for Arsenal.
Guy on the Tube wearing an Arsenal shirt with Gallas on the back. Takes some nerve to do that. Suppose it's not Adebayor...
 On @TSKeysandGray after 10.30am talking Arsenal, Carling Cup, lufc and mufc and Chelsea 
 Collins scores for Shrewsbury. After Arsenal's early flourish, Shrewsbury grew in confidence. Now it's a major test for #afc. 0-1 
 @De_Law Er, they're champions, have made a magnificent start. Arsenal aren't and have made worst start for 58 years. Bit of a difference... 
@Arsenalman2011 you need help for that paranoia. Of course it'll be in the paper. I was at Arsenal so can't be in 2 places at once!
Busy morning followed by #afc presser with Wenger at lunchtime. Big game for Arsenal ahead.
 Bizarre animal likeness... #afc boss Wenger happy to be Arsenal's polar bear, soaking up bullets to spare youngsters: ://tinyurl.com/3udsuc7  
 Much noisier, belief coming back a bit for #afc. RvP so important to Arsenal. Quality goal, quality finish. #bwfc come out a bit more 1-0 
All over. #afc really got to grips with second half. Huge win for Arsenal and Wenger. RvP terrific today. Great captain's display. 3-0 f/t
 @galboy_ledge @kyranok18 I was at Arsenal so, as much as I'd love to time travel... I'll be relying on MotD 
#Arsenal open training and press conference later ahead of Olympiacos game. Is it still c or back to k? I enjoy Champs League weeks
 #afc just presented doyen of football writers, Brian Glanville, with an Arsenal shirt to mark his 80th birthday. Classy touch, classy club. 
 Where on earth would #afc be without Szczesny? Another brilliant performance from the Arsenal keeper. Nervy, but a precious 3 points. 2-1 
@mcfcforum Just had another on saying if it was Arsenal we'd dig out Wenger for 'losing dressing room.' Welcome to my world.
Get calling! Join us on #afc Fans Forum. Via Arsenal website now
 @BlackScarfAFC Sorry, rhetorical question. Arsenal flirted with relegation that season. Stewart Houston, a top man, gave everything 
 #Arsenal press conf at lunchtime. Every game seems a must-win for Wenger at the moment. Koscielny back, Song in midfield, #afc stronger 
 @nadderley off today, arsenal tomorrow 
 @markpougatch He was given presentation by chelsea, fulham and arsenal upon reaching 80. (Obviously arsenal the best...) 
 Off to #afc v #safc shortly. Nervy game for both sides. Arsenal gotta find some form. No wonder Bruce supports Wenger, he's feeling it too. 
 That's more like the Arshavin Arsenal had hoped for. Incredible run, great dribbling and shot just wide. 1-1. 15 left. #afc #safc 
Touchdown Brad Friedel. Nicked from a funnier man than me in the Arsenal press room.
 @talkSPORTDrive Honestly, one of Arsenal's better players. 7. So improved last season. This is not red specs as many other players been 4 
 @talkSPORTDrive Honestly, @WarrenHaughton @clintemmins are so negative about Arsenal... 
@Unique99 completely agree and died in the wool arsenal fan. Shame on those who don't back him

Great win for #afc. Could this be a turning point for Arsenal's season? Will certainly lift morale. Koscielny outstanding. Ramsey top finish
 @fredisdead @arsenal_ratings Sadly, not. Mic must have been broken. Henry, Cesc, Kolo even Gallas done it in past. Sure he will nxt time... 
@ArsenalColumn I was unaware of yr column. I've been writing a weekly column on Arsenal since Mirror Football began. Good luck with yours
@MartinLipton @janineself didn't agree. Anyone would think Arsenal had lost! They say Wenger's lost it but Steve Bruce is a genius. *COUGHS*

 @ManUtd24 Well, if it's a column on Arsenal... what's the problem? I don't even call mine that on Twitter! 
@Darren_V_ I'll get onto Arsenal FC and get them to change their name because they've nicked their name off Arsenal Column
 @BackwardsGooner @Davidhigman Not my choice. To be honest, I've got no problem either way. Can't see how column on Arsenal can be copyright! 
@SandraHelena39 @mikesard Am easy going about it. But how can you copyright a column on Arsenal? But it's not really my call. Up to designer
@joelfleetwood @MikeSard @sandrahelena39 Arsenal have their AGM. Spurs had one last year. Is that breach of copyright? Can u call it that?
No Victoria Line on Sunday. So don't forget Arsenal u-18s plays Chelsea u-18s straight after main game. Stay on. No excuses for leaving!
@SaraA82 @btlifesapitch @janineself @martinlipton Do u mean the Invicibles? Or his many titles at Arsenal... Gyan cost x5 as much as rvp

 @Sutfol99 @BTLifesapitch Oh, okay. Spurs should snap up Hoddle, Arsenal Adams and Cantona at United. Were good players but emphasis on were 
 Crouch so prolific. Game of head tennis in #afc box. Basically, Arsenal lost every challenge. No change there. 1-1 Crouch 34 mins #afc #scfc 
59671 attendance at Arsenal
RvP is out warming up for Arsenal...
 Chants of 'one van Persie' ring round the ground. Not that Arsenal are in danger of becoming a one man team, you understand... 
Gervinho cross to RvP and Begovic fumbles. RvP the man for Arsenal. One man team - you betcha. But guess u can rest him if he does that. 2-1
 Where would Arsenal be without RvP? In relegation trouble probably... #afc. You can't rest him or be without him, Arsene. 2-1 #afc 
3 Gervinho assists. Another Begovic fumble. Arsenal 6 wins out of 7. Moving up league... #afc. Stoke another bad away day after Europe. 3-1
Ramsey good also. Arteta had his best game for Arsenal so far. #afc in good form (6 out of 7). Moving On Up. But RvP man of match in 16 mins
Arsenal fans enjoying the 6-1 scoreline here at Emirates. Maybe it doesn't make 8-2 look so memorable after all!
All over at Arsenal. 3-1 and another day belonging to RvP. #afc are up to 7th and in good form.

Milan for Arsenal. Napoli for Chelsea. So much for the benefits of winning the Group. Hardest draws of all for the two English survivors.
 #mcfc started well but #afc and Szczesny weathered storm. Arsenal grew stronger, City still dangerous. Gary Neville top co comms, Dowd poor.

Heading to Aston Villa v Arsenal shortly. Big test for #afc with no full backs or Song. Bigger test for #avfc boss McLeish who needs support
Just been pointed out to me by @CapableOfFlight that Coquelin autocorrected to conquering right back. Arsenal will be hoping so...
Not much hope for Villa here at Villa Park among the locals. They're expecting Arsenal to just turn up and win. No chance. Always tight here
 Villa made much the better start. Arsenal shaky in defence, saved by Szczesny. Villa causing all the problems. Ramsey good block. 0-0 
Penalty to Arsenal
Koscielny and Mertesacker doing well for Arsenal. Coquelin struggling and Albrighton giving Vermaelen problems. Can Villa exploit weakness?
Back underway at Villa Park. Villa have picked up where they left off. Made decent start. Arsenal will have to work hard to get all 3 points
Villa in command now. Big response from McLeish's men tonight and Arsenal second best. 1-1
 Wenger says Arsenal got a bit 'lucky' and was very positive on Villa. Praised #afc spirit, RvP and says Sagna could be back mid-Jan.

My view on whether #afc should re-sign Arsenal legend Thierry Henry: ://bit.ly/uDOF4h  Let me know your views...
 @wiganlaticsblue I generally stick to that - and get stick for only tweeting on Arsenal, the club I get sent to cover a lot. Happy New Year 
Jarvis could have gone down under Djourou challenge in #afc box. Arsenal counterattack. Great pass by Yossi. Gervinho good finish - for once
Benayoun and Rosicky (2 squad players) playing v well for #afc. Arsenal change it and Arshavin still doesn't get in. Hunt busy for Wolves.
Typically it was Hunt who put the ball back in the mixer for Fletcher's equaliser. He's been a thorn in Arsenal's side all game. 1-1
Arsenal have got really desperate - Chamakh is on.
All over. 1-1. Arsenal frustrated. Hard to know which manager will be more annoyed with Attwell. Hennessey MoM. Bad for #afc. #wwfc happy.

 Half time. Swansea playing super stuff, been tight game but they've edged it while Arsenal dangerous on counter. 1-1. 
 Arsenal conceded three but Koscielny been superb, absolutely outstanding. Shows how bad the rest of the defence has been. 3-2 
Great win for Swansea. They've deserved this. 3-2. They out-Arsenal-ed Arsenal. 3-2. They're celebrating wildly - and so they should.

Team now aboard. About to fly so catch up from Milan. Fancy #afc to go through. Big test for Arsenal.
 Second Arsenal press conference, this time at San Siro. Journey brought flashbacks of terrifying lift in Malcolm MacDonald's car circa 1994. 
 Wenger tightens up the #afc midfield (Song, Arteta, Ramsey, Rosicky) and has pace and options from the bench. Think Arsenal will score. 
 It's the flanks that are worst. Purely coincidental of course that Arsenal's width and pace beat Milan last time... Wifi rubbish, too. #afc 
 Just when Arsenal thought it couldn't get worse, their best defender tonight, Koscielny, limps off. 2-0 and unless #afc score it looks grim. 
From bad to worse. You know it's bad if Zlatan scores. 4-0 AC Milan. Humiliation for Arsenal.

#afc 1-0 Gibbs. Rich reward for a brilliant month for the Arsenal left back. Rare blunder by Given lets shot through.
 Terrific first half by #afc. Arsenal been far told good for Villa. 2-0 h/t. Gibbs and Walcott on target, could have been more. Villa poor. 
 Mr Angry, as we call season ticket holder in front of press box, on his feet in fury now Arsenal not doing so well. Never saw him 1st half. 
 Ramsey and Santos on for Gervinho and Gibbs, 68 mins. Arsenal 2-0 up, just looking to regain initiative. 
 All over. #afc win 3-0. Arsenal superb. Good all round performance, hard to pick a MoM. Oh go on then: Walcott. Even Mr Angry looks happy. 
Villa very poor. Marginally better second half. Their niggly fouls said much about their performance/ambition. Arsenal fully deserved win.

#afc Arsenal coach just turned up. Not exactly a warm welcome... But can hear Maria Petri cheering
 Arsenal started quite well. QPR in determined mood, game a bit niggly already. 0-0. QPR fans getting right behind their team. 
 Arsenal fans barracking QPR keeper:   Paddy Kenny: he eats what he wants.   Bit harsh. QPR having good spell. 0-0 
QPR bang up for this. Arsenal haven't been so far. You can't argue with 1-0 for QPR. They're looking lively. Arsenal not playing well. 1-0
 Ramsey, stuck on the left, been really poor for Arsenal. Ox and Gervinho on the bench. QPR been much the better team 1-0 
 RvP slipped ball through to Walcott. His first shot hit post but Walcott scored on the rebound. Arsenal not been playing well, but resilient 
Half time at Loftus Road. 1-1. QPR shaded it in my opinion. But Arsenal finished well. Taarabt first Prem goal. Walcott levels. ood game.
Brilliantly taken goal by Diakite to make it 2-1 QPR. Arsenal have not defended well and Vermaelen slipped up again. 68 gone
Vermaelen having a stinker. Hard to see a way back for Arsenal. QPR defending well and still causing Arsenal problems. 2-1 75 gone
 Arsenal 2-1 down, just over 8 left so send for the cavalry!!! They weren't available so on came Chamakh. QPR lifted straight away... 
That looked like a penalty to Arsenal. Onuoha picked it up and carried it to safety... Only kidding. But did look a pen. 2-1
All over. QPR win 2-1. They fought hard and got deserved win. Arsenal were poor.
 Arsenal players unhappy at end. Few moan at ref. Should look at themselves today. AOC goes to away fans, throws shirt to them - great touch 
 @JLQPR I thought QPR were terrific today, thoroughly deserved it. Arsenal were poor but they weren't nearly as fired up as QPR. Good luck. 
Excellent feature on Arsenal new boy Podolski in Sun by @CharlieWyett Treat yourself to a copy to pay for his air fare and German sausage.
@MarkG_Arsenal I've heard Kastro has already ordered a dozen bottles ahead of a 'hot date.'
 Great fun Citreon ad. Four Arsenal stars - Song, Szczesny, Sagna, Ox - learn moves with the English National Ballet ://bit.ly/I15P8V  
Back on duty today for Arsenal v Man City. Should be a cracker. A must win for both but I fancy a draw. Sure Nasri will get a warm welcome..
Nasri's name greeted with very loud boo by #afc fans in stadium. Clichy given just a loud boo. Now playing Good Old Arsenal. Love tradition.
Yaya really struggling. Smashed his knee against Song's knee when fouled. He can barely run. Arsenal dominant but few roads through. 0-0
Dramatic goal line clearance from Vermaelen - shame it was to block RvP header giving Arsenal the lead. Pizarro coming on for Yaya. 0-0
Ox coming on for Arsenal
Arteta has been a revelation for #afc. Arsenal been much the better side today. Arsenal fans now doing the Poznan. No love lost!
 Arsenal win and City lose the title. The Arsenal delight goes beyond three points. Nasri, Clichy and the rest. Big questions now of Mancini. 
Nasri left Arsenal in search of trophies. None at City either. Wonder if he'll ever question whether he's part of the problem. Doubt it.
 As for Arsenal, so impressive today. Arteta magnificent. Has really stepped up. Wenger can strengthen this summer and challenge next season.

Greetings from Molineux. Moxey Out banners outside. All not well at Wolves. Can Arsenal take advantage? Fletcher dropped for Wolves
 Three changes for Arsenal. Santos, Djourou and Ramsey in starting line-up. Wenger loves Ramsey away from home. Rosicky drops out. 
 Arsenal haven't needed to get out of 1st gear after 11th minute. RvP, Walcott on target. Wolves fans booing everything & everybody @ h/t 0-2 
Jenkinson on for Sagna. The Arsenal fan in Jenkinson will be enjoying this. 0-3. Just over 5 left #afc
Into final minute of 3 added minutes at Molineux. Arsenal 3-0 up. Szczesny now waving to the travelling fans. 'He saves when he wants etc'
All over. Arsenal win 3-0 at Wolves. Easy after Walcott and RvP double act destroyed Wolves inside 11 minutes. Benayoun deserved third.

#afc Wenger responds to Sol Campbell calling for Arsenal to spend big. 'Sol has a lot of money - he's welcome to give us a gift.' Classic.
 @BlackScarfAFC Yes, at least he's trying. Shame for 2nd day running we gave more coverage to Wigan than Arsenal. Must be those big crowds... 
 Off to Arsenal v Wigan. But even I might concede game I'm going to on Weds, Chelsea v Barcelona, might be bigger. #forgivemearsene 
#afc Wenger hails 'remarkable achievement' of Arsenal's recovery in his prog notes. Chamakh is also interviewed. Always 'ready' apparently.
 Wigan 2-0 up. Incredible. Arsenal have, er, taken things bit lightly. Gomez. 
Arsenal been a shambles and have a lot of coming back to do. And without the injured Arteta. Those Wigan fans might find journey worthwhile.
Chaos in the Arsenal defence. And they look flat everywhere else. Wigan's fluid tactics and formation leaving Arsenal puzzled and losing 1-2
Ox getting stripped and ready for action as #afc third sub. Chamakh thrown his gloves down in disgust. Arsenal fans breath sigh of relief.
 The remaining Arsenal fans in the stadium clap Wigan off the pitch. That's sporting, class and what Wigan deserve. They were superb. 1-2 
Match report: Arsenal 1 Wigan 2. Arsenal so busy telling Spurs to mind the gap they fell down the hole themselves: ://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Arsenal-1-2-Wigan-Latics-boost-survival-hopes-beat-Gunners-days-after-beating-Manchester-United-article891653.html …
@timpayton @arseblog I agree. If you start badly/sloppily it often sets the tone. Arsenal had possession/chances but little spark.
@RonakKataria Amused. Fans mostly remember negatives about own team. Arsenal fans think media ignore diving unless it's Eduardo. We don't
Fabregas recalls celebrating Barcelona going through at Chelsea even though Arsenal had lost semi night before. 'Whole family Barca fans'
Fabregas has answered more questions in this CL press conference than he did in his final year at Arsenal. At least he got what he wanted.
Fabregas: 'I've learned a lot tactically. I know my position on pitch. At Arsenal I played wherever I wanted and was not good tactically'
 Fabregas: 'I got lost tactically on the pitch at Arsenal, I played where I wanted. At Barca I  am more mature. I do job for the team.' Ouch!

 Working in Starbucks near Chelsea. No proper cups allowed because of the game, according to woman behind counter (insert Arsenal joke here). 
 Meanwhile, RDM hints he will bring in 'fresh faces' to play Arsenal on Sat. Can you risk gambling on 4th place to save players for Nou Camp?

 Sensational @premierleague I Pad #20seasons app. Vote for all yr best of last 20 years. It's easy: Arsenal, Wenger, Henry, Invincibles 
Watch Arsenal v Chelsea then straight off to QPR v Spurs. Pivotal day in race for top 4 & relegation. Thought for day: No cheats at Olympics
 Arsenal looked so nervous. And tired. Don't think it was a pen, but #afc fans would be moaning if RvP had gone down like that against them. 
Poor planning to have Arsenal and Spurs clashing on Tube on way to and from games. Remind me why we didn't help Chelsea's fixtures again?
Off to #QPR v #thfc now. Huge game. Points vital. Still fancy QPR to get to safety. But need a result. Arsenal have opened door for Spurs.
@timpayton Have to say that Arsenal fans would be going mad about RvP if he'd gone down like that for an opposing team against them.
It's now you're getting v nervous before @londonmarathon... I ran last year and went straight to cover Arsenal v Liverpool. So no excuses!
Off to #afc Arsenal Supporters' Trust meeting. Always fun but possibly less lively than last year. Then early flight to Barcelona in morning

 Wenger says Park will replace injured Diaby (calf) in an otherwise unchanged squad. Wenger says RvP is 'world class, committed to Arsenal.' 
 @robshepherd5 I thought that initially. Hope he stays - an asset to PL, not just Arsenal. But not sure. (Can't make up mind after last nite) 
Buy-buy not bye-bye. #afc Wenger on why Arsenal can be confident of keeping van Persie. And on 'interesting' Vertonghen ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-to-buy-big-to-convince-robin-819260 …
2 Arsenal landmarks. 900 games up for Wenger. Last home game for Pat Rice. Amazing servant for Arsenal. Have feeling Norwich may spoil party
Pat Rice an Arsenal legend. Deserves a statue. Even if sometimes I think he'd like games played with no fans and definitely no press there!
 #afc Wenger uses programme notes to praise 'tremendous' support from Arsenal fans. Picks out Holt, E Bennett, Pilkington as dangers today 
That's been coming. Arsenal been awful. 1-1. Hoolahan. Shocking mistake by Szczesny
Arsenal intent on blowing third place here. Norwich well on top. Arsenal look sooooo nervous. 1-1
 Arsenal playing worse today than I've seen at the Emirates all season. 1-1. If they mess it up, serious question marks over bottle. 
Norwich ahead 1-2. Shocking by Arsenal. Norwich fans chanting: 'Thursday night Channel 5.' They may miss out on that at this rate. Holt
 No signs of an Arsenal recovery. In fact, Norwich still much the better team and far more likely to score the next goal. 1-2 
Arsenal have just got away with it - clear penalty. Koscielny has taken a chunk of Russell Martin's shirt home as a souvenir.
Arsenal booed off at half time. They've been shocking. Absolutely shocking. Not able to string 2 passes together. Norwich battered em 1-2
Arsenal out first for the 2nd half. They weren't first in any respect in the first half. Norwich 2-1 up and should have been more
Arsenal should be at least 4-1 down by now. RvP and Ramsey missed great chances. Here comes Ox. Huge cheer went up when Ramsey name went up
Jackson went clean through and passed back to Szczesny. Arsenal's crosses always hit first man. What does Ox have to do to get a game?!
That was coming. Arsenal still had no bottle even at 3-2 up. They've been shocking. Norwich deserved this. 3-3
That's it. 3-3. Wenger will moan about penalty never given. But Arsenal were poor in terms of performance and bottle. Bye bye 3rd place
 Arsenal about to do a lap of appreciation. Frankly, that performance didn't show much appreciation towards their fans. 
Jackson went clean through and passed back to Szczesny. Arsenal's crosses always hit first man. What does Ox have to do to get a game?!
 Final web piece: funny how this weekend smacks of 2006. Arsenal, Spurs, Champs Lge places, Martin Jol but no lasagne ://bit.ly/KSnEDx  
A lot of Arsenal youth team players still around the training ground. I've been told I must learn to say #decent to get down with the kids
 I see Fulham are bang up for it on Sunday. Dempsey, believed to be leaving this summer, is out. Win or bust for Arsenal. 
   @CcfcMason: @johncrossmirror west brom are playing arsenal u clown   >> And this is one of the polite ones. Really?! You don't say. 
@CcfcMason @laurie_afc If Arsenal don't beat West Brom and a Dempsey-less Fulham lose at Spurs then Spurs finish third. I know it's tricky..
 @MattLawExpress Man City 3 QPR 2, Stoke 2 Bolton 2, WBA 1 Arsenal 1, Tottenham 4 Fulham 0, Everton 1 Newcastle 3, Norwich 17 Villa -12 
 Come on. Got to launch a campaign to give Thierry Henry his goal back and keep him on 229 Arsenal goals, a club record. #afc 
 And final day goes to the wire with title, Champs League and relegation issues still to be decided. I'm off to West Brom v Arsenal tomorrow. 
 @JamesDoddTS @LaurensJulien @talkSPORTDrive Oh my. I'm sure Adrian will get a hero's welcome! I love, love, love Daily Arsenal. See u Mon 
En route to West Brom for #wba v #afc. Arsenal yet to win when Arteta hasn't played. Huge test. Big for West Brom - send off for Hodgson.
@Sawyer_Arsenal Now that's a good stat
Hawthorns. Stage is set. Arsenal's destiny in their hands. Hodgson's farewell. Speech expected after final whistle ://twitpic.com/9km0ib 
The Wifi at West Brom nearly as temperamental as the defending. Fulop has been Arsenal's best player. Long is killing Arsenal. 2-2 h/t
Surely more goals to come at Hawthorns because Fulop is having awful game for West Brom and Arsenal so vulnerable at the back
All over. Arsenal win 2-3. Clinch third and Champs League.
 Arsenal fans going wild, their support superb throughout. Fulop Arsenal's best player. At fault for every Arsenal goal. 
#afc players carry Pat Rice shoulder high to Arsenal fans. Gets great ovation. Gets the bumps!
RvP goes alone over to Arsenal fans to clap them. Fights way past stewards to do so. Arsenal fans chant: 'He scores when he wants.' #afc
Gibbs' block on Jones in 92nd minute most important tackle of Arsenal's season. Saved certain West Brom equaliser. #afc
Wenger hails his Arsenal heroes - and admits 5 mins injury time gave him a tense ending
 Important for Arsenal now to grasp the moment and build on third and the certainty of Champions League football. Oh, and to celebrate.. #afc

 I missed the point today. I leant @talkSPORTDrive some shin pads when most wanted him to get kicked. Mind u, he was wearing Arsenal socks... 
 Arsenal will offer RvP new deal, chance to remain king of the hill, could hold him to final year. But will they spend to match his ambition? 
He's got great affection for Arsenal and would surely prefer abroad. But Juve only foreign club in so far. Real and Barca yet to come in.
 On Talksport @sportsbreakfast at 7am. After our bet Arsenal finishing above Spurs, surely Al hasn't forgotten my bottle of bubbly... 
Arsenal have assured me that Tomas Rosicky doesn't have a Twitter account. @officialrosicky is yet another fake. Why do people bother?!
I'm sure Arsenal fans can persuade @modernmilk to give RvP a lifetime's supply of free milk if he signs a new contract.
#afc RvP not ready to sign new contract on offer at Arsenal. Juventus think he's set his heart on another club. #mcfc?://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/robin-van-persie-refuses-to-sign-837983 …

 Schtop, I'm not ready: Van Persie refuses to sign new Arsenal contract. #mcfc #mufc and Juve keen. Plus M'Vila, Powell: ://bit.ly/J5j5Hj  
Arsenal mate of mine seen Twitter debate and rang. He wants Chelsea. Not for Chelsea but for what it does to Spurs.
I do find it surprising so many Arsenal fans want Bayern to win to put Spurs in Champions League. I can almost feel the love in North London
@SandraHelena39 So you try patronising him and telling him he's not an Arsenal fan. Some have a hatred of Spurs. Amazed u don't get that.
@RomeshRanga @garethdparker Had an Arsenal fan onto me yesterday singing 'Blue is the colour.' His hatred of Spurs far outweighs Chelsea
@PadraigGoggin @DarrenArsenal1 The oldest Arsenal fan I know wants Chelsea to win because of Spurs. If Spurs had finished 3rd so would they.

Wenger likely to speak today & will blame fitness issues on RvP's absence from the Asia tour. Arsenal stress RvP been professional this week
 Wenger on @arsenal website: 'RvP is one of the best strikers in the world, if not the best, and my desire is to keep him at the club.' 
 Wenger “I will do what's in best interests of Arsenal FC. That, at the moment, is where we are. There is not a lot more to say than that.'

 RvP out? Cazorla in? That wouldn't be too bad, I reckon. But RvP saga may run and run so will affect Arsenal's ability to build and replace 
 #afc Arsenal confirm Laurent Koscielny has agreed a new contract, as reported in Mirror Sport: ://tinyurl.com/c6zmzky  
Juventus turn up the heat on Arsenal for their top target RvP. Juve and #mufc lead the chase. #afc close in on Cazorla://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/robin-van-persie-transfer-juventus-1169020 …
 Here's my #afc web column on RvP, Cazorla and Podolski heading up new look Arsenal for next season; ://bit.ly/MIxCii  
#afc Arsenal boss Wenger makes Cazorla central to his plans in the absence of Wilshere. Expect more deals with RvP out: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-line-up-santi-cazorla-1172343 …
#afc Arsenal boss Wenger on Sahin stories: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/transfer-gossip-arsenal-manchester-united-1173892 …
AS reporting Arsenal made 23m Euro bid for Cazorla. Shall we have a sweep on how long it takes for Wenger to deny it? #dontbeakilljoyArsene
Seems a bit harsh that Arsenal sent Park Chu-Young to Coventry. But he's scored against Switzerland. 1-1
#thfc still in for Real Madrid starlet Sahin - and would Arsenal sign him and Cazorla? Maybe.... ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-santi-cazorla-chase-1196167 …
 With #afc Arsenal set to complete a 20m deal for Cazorla, will that soften blow of RvP and ensure he becomes a forgotten man? Major deal. 
 And, for about the 5th day running, Arsenal remain confident on Cazorla. Some red tape to be cut but will be great deal ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/robin-van-persie-camp-express-1201916 … 
@ArsenalFCView I just can't see him staying and I can't see Arsenal not selling if he wont re-sign in August.
@AndyRobins_PSRB @arsenalfcview I agree with u on United. They buy into moneyball. Don't think Arsenal think they'll go to that level either
And RvP off to Germany - with Arsenal. Could he start season at #afc? They've shown that ambition he's been on about...://tinyurl.com/d4ccoyf

Can practically hear Wenger already: 'one Group only has 7 teams. This is not fair...' Just joking touchy Arsenal fans. Group then k/o's
RvP and Arshavin also join training camp but poor Bendtner left behind. Busy days yet to come for Arsenal: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-santi-cazorla-will-join-1228071 …

Arsenal knock back £4m bid for Arshavin from Galatasaray and will Barca finally bid for Song? ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-andrey-arshavin-is-a-target-1227260 …
 Been rushing, rushing this morning. Great bit of business by Arsenal to sign Cazorla as worst kept secret finally confirmed. Class player. 
 Old boys' network talked me into #afc move, says Cazorla. Pires and Fabregas sell Arsenal to new Spanish star: ://tinyurl.com/clpf5cn  
 Hard to know, however, whether Barcelona will tell Arsenal they'd like to sign Alex Song before they unveil him in the Nou Camp... 
 Song is different to other #afc transfer sagas (Cesc, Nasri, RvP etc). If Arsenal sell then it will be their choice, not forced upon them. 
 RvP favours #mufc. Arsenal don't want to sell to direct rival. It'd be same for #mcfc. But RvP told City, Juve he doesn't want to join them. 
#mufc boss Ferguson admits on RvP: 'We're not getting any breakthrough with Arsenal. It's difficult to say why they're operating this way.'
 While Arsenal remain resolute on RvP, the latest on Song also here. It's a different scenario. #afc also hold cards:://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/robin-van-persie-transfer-arsenal-1238159 …

@buckstaar Arsenal certainly got annoyed when string of Barca players did the same so I take your point. But most clubs do it
And RvP still at #afc. No movement. Here's pics from @Arsenal website from this morning's training session to prove it: ://tinyurl.com/cftcgz3 
@JamesonStephen Every fan thinks journos show bias against their club. Which probably proves a point. Arsenal fans think I'm anti Arsenal.
 RvP set to play for Arsenal vs Cologne tomorrow. He's trained well. If he stays at club, surely he must keep armband: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/robin-van-persie-set-to-play-1247469 … 
Spanish press had Song agreeing personal terms with Barca this week - before anything agreed with Arsenal. In a similar way to RvP/City?!
 If #mufc come back with big offer (not 100pc convinced they will) then things may change, otherwise RvP set to start season at Arsenal. 
@Ergenton No one is disputing Arsenal overpaid for Jeffers. Think you're being harsh comparing Allen to Jeffers. Allen won't be that bad.
 And football's back... At Arsenal training ground for open England training session. Butland and Ruddy here first, doing some running. 
Sagna coming out to train on his own. Still looking at mid September. Silvestre also training here with Arsenal while looking for a club
 The deal Arsenal had to do. RvP loses his #afc legend status, #mufc get a top striker. But where does it leave #afc?://tinyurl.com/blh4gkg  
Arsenal will decide on Song. If they can get £15m plus that's great business for a player who is far from irreplaceable.
 Confirmation of @arsenal squad numbers. Podolski no 9, Wilshere no10. Great touch and boost for Wilshere. Quality #afc://tinyurl.com/cs8naae  
Wilshere on 'honour' of being Arsenal's new no10. #afc offering refunds on any new shirts with 19. Quality all round:://tinyurl.com/bw57ckz 
Cannot wait for new Prem Lge season to begin. I'm at #afc v #safc tomorrow. Huge day for worried Arsenal fans with RvP gone and Song going.
@daraobriain I genuinely feel Arsenal have better all round attacking options. Cazorla could be gr8. Think def/def mid needed. U optimistic?
I think Arsenal have better attacking depth. Cazorla could be signing of the summer. Selling Song is good business. Promising season ahead.

 @Matt_Law_SM @simon_cassDM Welcome back, Matthew. Completely disagree, I'm afraid. Great move by Arsenal to sell - and great price.

 Arsenal Group looking very good, Even if it will spark an annual 'is it C or K' debate for one of the opponents Olympiacos (aka Olympiakos). 
 #cfc RDM was asked about Essien future earlier. There's been Fenerbahce, Arsenal interest. Sounded like RDM wouldn't want/allow Essien to go 
#afc Essien is NOT joining Arsenal. It's not something they've been pursuing today. #cfc
#cfc RdM confirmed before kick off that Essien could be going out on loan - but as I said earlier not to Arsenal
My understanding is that Arsenal were offered Essien - and not the other way round. They politely declined but was never on today's agenda
 Sahin a great bet to score. That's how football works. As for Arsenal, they'll be happy if anyone breaks the duck. Great move to play Ox.

The greatest name in Arsenal history. Sir Chips Keswick is re elected.
 Wenger says Arsenal compete for 5 trophies, one being Champs Lge qualification. 'A new player doesn't want to know if you've won lge cup' 
 Actually, @timpayton is right. Wenger makes it clear he's happy to meet Arsenal fans. Gazidis also says he will. PHW shouldn't. 
 When Arsenal won the FA Cup in 2003 and 2005, the team and Wenger was questioned as it was 'just' the FA Cup and not enough. 
 Having said all that, seven years without a trophy is far too long for a club like Arsenal. And that's why, now, everything gets questioned.

 Fabulous news for #afc Wilshere starts first game for Arsenal since May 2011. England, Arsenal, English football expects. No pressure then. 
Really feel for Jenkinson. Drops down to the bench for Sagna. He's been superb for Arsenal. Could have played left back rather than Santos.
 But it's a bold move by Wenger to lift Arsenal mood. Walcott on the bench, too. Big day for #afc 
 Santos is Arsenal's new Eboue. Loveable fella, great character - but not up to it at this level. #afc 
Taarabt shoulder charge decks Wilshere. The Arsenal crowd wanted to lynch him. Wilshere won't mind that challenge. #afc
Referee Anthony Taylor rapidly losing control. Arsenal have had plenty of free kick opportunities. All of them have been poor. 0-0.
It's in - Arsenal have scored! Arteta 1-0 #afc
Mannone saves free kick. Arsenal fans biting their nails... 1-0
All over! Arsenal win 1-0
Arsenal fans rightly appalled at a chant towards Wenger and lack of action against it. So hope stick towards RvP doesn't go beyond booing.

 @piersmorgan In this age where finance has moved football's goalposts, I think Arsenal's greatest ever manager has done exceptionally well 
@piersmorgan Would u swap Arsenal's last seven years since 2005 for Liverpool's? Domestic trophies versus Champions League place every year?
 @piersmorgan I remember in 2003, it felt like a consolation prize. When Arsenal nearly missed out on top 4 last year, it felt like a crisis.

 #afc Wilshere ready for England call. Also on comeback fears, Theo, his red card and Arsenal ambition. Such a good lad. ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jack-wilshere-wants-england-call-1423261 … 
 @AlexStone7 No one wanted to go in goal on the playground, or we were one short. Now everyone wants to go up front at Arsenal! 
 @AFCesc4 I Googled Manchester United Arsenal and Rooney dive and got: about 1,650,000 results 
At Great Ormond Street Hospital for an Arsenal press conference. As you do. Any other #afc player wanna play up front?
 @Matt_Law_SM Sorry, I'll delete ASAP! Unlikely to get injured dropping a mic on his foot but what benefit do Arsenal get from him doing TF1? 
@darrenbyfield What benefit does doing French TV give to Arsenal? Why wouldn't fans want managers to concentrate on their own team?
 @darrenbyfield No wonder Arsenal sign lots of French players! He works for TF1. Anyway, u told me to move on. U think Wilshere should be in? 
Arsenal's best corner of the season. Who took it? Walcott. Appreciated by his team mates. Give him the deal. Giroud - proper striker's goal.
 2-1 Fulham score. Ruiz corner, Arsenal allow Berbatov completely free header from within the 6 yard box (I kid you not). 
 Arsenal have gone from looking full of confidence, belief returned at 2-0, to looking fragile lambs again at 2-1. #afc 2 #ffc 1 
 2-2 Fulham equalise. Once again, Arsenal's defending horrific. Kacaniklic header. Fan just walked past saying: bring back Pat Rice 
I nearly tweeted earlier that Fulham's defending on Arsenal's goals was worst I've seen this season. Then Arsenal eclipsed them. 2-2
Fulham come within a whisker of making it 2-3. Chaos in Arsenal's defence. Arsenal fans boo the team off at half time. It is 2-2 h/time.
 Arteta mistake, pulls down Ruiz. Fulham penalty. Beautifully converted by Berbatov. Fulham lead 3-2. Arsenal a shambles. 
Koscielny makes goal saving tackle on Berbatov. First decent tackle from an Arsenal player all game
Arsenal penalty
Fulham's equaliser should have been saved by Mannone. Arteta had his worst game in an Arsenal shirt. Berbatov a pure joy to watch.  #motd
 Giroud had his best game in an Arsenal shirt. Two goals, power and was a threat. If he'd taken the penalty... But never a penalty. Justice. 
@arseblog @christoronyi Giroud had his best game in Arsenal shirt. Arsenal's whole problem is being short in all areas. That really is dumb.
 @arseblog @christoronyi I disagree. Lovely player. Time and again, Arsenal don't buy enough players for each position. Look at Diaby. Dumb.

Watched Arsenal's win over Spurs. Incredible how people can question Walcott's value on every level. Theo put those people in their place.
Not a good day for Adebayor. Starts it by questioning Arsenal's philosophy. Ends it by seeing red and losing 5-2. Arsenal's man of the match
@BeltransMole23 Great. Arsenal win a game and therefore never have to buy another player ever.
@BeltransMole23 He can also be wildly brilliant. I've always enjoyed watching him. Arsenal been known to indulge an inconsistent player or 2

At the Emirates. Big chance for Arsenal to qualify tonight. Surely Saturday's thumping win will have brought back some missing confidence...
Arsenal yet to find any rhythm. And their passing is shocking. Absolutely shocking. It's 0-0 and very tight. #afc need to find another gear.
 Yanga-Mbiwa looks the business for Montpellier in midfield tonight. Quality defender, too. Quality. No wonder lots like him - inc Arsenal. 
All over. Arsenal win 2-0 and qualify for the knock-out stages along with Schalke. #afc

 Arsenal away support always terrific, noisy and singing. But never understand why the Emirates can be so quiet. Cat and mouse so far. 0-0 
Villa bossing it. Arsenal being caught out by Villa's pressing and work rate. All fans applaud through 19th min for Petrov. #supportstan
 Arsenal come back well, enjoying their best spell. Ramsey gone closest. 0-0 
Arsenal missing Theo Walcott today. Worth thinking about when it comes to evaluating a player's value in monetary terms and to the squad.
Arsenal need Wilshere's craft. Villa playing at such intensity. 0-0
Arsenal fans booing and chanting 'you don't know what you're doing' as Coquelin comes on for Giroud. Giroud been too deep
0-0 and a stadium's toes are frozen. Villa fans feel they should have won. Arsenal not great.
@MickTheGooner You mean to say he's not representative of your average Arsenal fan?! How very dare you...
Finished writing up my Arsenal Villa piece for Mon. Last week Wenger was a hero. This week he doesn't know what he's doing. More respect due

Swansea started brightly and are dangerous going forward. They can commit more players as Arsenal have Gervinho playing up front. #forgetit
Arsenal have made a slow start which lacks tempo. The chant should be: 'Where has our pace and tempo gone?' Been missing recently. 0-0
Sensational Szczesny double save from Rangel stops Swansea going ahead. Arsenal fast asleep. Swansea bossing the game. 0-0
 Cazorla header - yes, really - brings a save out of Tremmel. Up until that point, Arsenal been playing like it's a pre-season friendly. Odd. 
 Swansea outclassing Arsenal. They're passing the ball brilliantly, finding gaps and an Arsenal full of apathy. 0-0. #afc rarely this bad. 
Arsenal's lack of physical presence is so obvious. Too many oompa loompas. Podolski and Gervinho's lack of desire an embarrassment. 0-0
Arsenal are playing as bad as they did at Norwich earlier this season. It's the worst I've seen them play at home for a long time. 0-0
 Moore on already for Swansea, Tiendalli about to come on. They've been terrific today, playing their part in making Arsenal look poor. 0-0 
Swansea score and deservedly so. Michu 1-0. Cue embarrassing mass exodus of Arsenal fans.
 Michu 0-2. Easy for Swansea, thoroughly deserved. Cue a fire drill among Arsenal fans. At least they won't get booed off - no-one left. 
Arsenal will be grateful only 3 mins added time otherwise Swansea would score again. They've been brilliant.
All over. Those that are left boo loudly while Swansea's fans celebrate wildly. Arsenal truly awful today. 0-2
Arsenal won't get into the Champions League places playing like this. It's not a one-off. Far from it. They've been poor most of the season.
Swansea continue to dumbfound. They get a standing ovation from the visiting fans and the remaining Arsenal fans (the proper hardcore).
 As good as Swansea were, Arsenal so poor. Wenger has spent big dough in recent seasons. On some bang average players. Sign quality again. 
Swansea boss Laudrup praises the 'fair play' of the Arsenal fans who applauded his team off. 'This is not more special than winning at QPR.'
Swansea boss Laudrup said: 'I don't think necessarily Arsenal are a worse team but they came up against a very good team today.'
It's not as if this is a one off. Arsenal have been stuck in a malaise for weeks. Even Spurs result didn't give them lift off. #afc
 Arsenal must sign in January. The squad needs strengthening but, more than anything, the dressing room needs a lift. #afc 
 @AlexWadey1 He's done a great job, I agree. His biggest signing is bigger than Arsenal's though. 
 @MirrorDarren Blimey, have you seen Podolski recently?!?! Not worry, neither have any Arsenal fans. 
@Jamie_Murphy8 @MirrorDarren Mertesacker has been Arsenal's best defender this season.

@whatgap My agenda is getting to Arsenal and there are no TVs on the Tube.
I think the phrase is 'needs a goal.' Arsenal 0 Newcastle 0 and not a classic by any means.
3-3 Ba Arsenal's full backs have been incredibly poor defensively
It's obviously Newcastle up next. Gibbs been great going forward. But all of Newcastle's goals been down to Arsenal's full backs.
Arsenal fans chanting 'sign him up' at Walcott. They pay enough in ticket prices. They should have a say. Get it done. #afc
The amazing thing about Arsenal v Newcastle was that the first half wasn't that good. So just imagine how good the second half was... #motd
I'm hoping bridges which are being built can be completed and an agreement reached. Arsenal need Walcott to stay. #afc
 @Toon_phil1892 I'd agree with that. I also think it's unfair Arsenal had the extra rest. It told in the last 20 mins, no doubt about it. 
 Driving to Southampton v Arsenal. Actually looking forward to my New Year's resolutions: dry January, diet and bit of a health kick. Needed! 
Southampton lead 1-0. Arsenal's defence a shambles. Ramires
1-1 Arsenal Do Prado own goal from Walcott free kick
You wouldn't believe this Arsenal team was the one which put 7 past Newcastle. They've not tested dodgy keeper Boruc and scored with an OG.
The trouble with Arsenal is that you don't know what you're gonna get. They have been on a great roll - and yet still lack a consistency.

 Arsenal 3 changes as Mertesacker, Ramsey and Giroud come in for Vermaelen, Podolski and Ox. Giroud through the middle - or  4-4-2 option... 
Aaron Ramsey getting booed by Swansea fans for his Cardiff connection. Arsenal fans chant: 'One Aaron Ramsey.' Makes a pleasant change.
 Arsenal made a much better start to second half. Penalty appeal, Giroud effort. Swansea respond with Hernandez and Michu coming on. 0-0 
 2-2 Full time. Cracking game. Swansea played some super stuff, Michu impact but Arsenal's spirit and great Gibbs goal saved them. Replay. 
Arsenal would have lost this game a month ago. But they showed fight to come back and Gibbs scored a cracker. Good comeback.

 @piersmorgan I agree that Arsenal need to strengthen in January to be sure of top four, otherwise... 
 Man City team (vs Arsenal): Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Nastasic, Clichy, Garcia, Barry, Milner, Tevez, Silva, Dzeko. Balotelli on bench 
Ox now sacrificed to bring on Mertesacker to shore up defence with Arsenal at ten men. Ox gets great reception. 0-0
Arsenal fallen to pieces. Milner an absolute screamer for 1-0. Now Arsenal can't find another red shirt. A problem when you only have 10 men
Arsenal down to ten men. Diaby playing his first game in four months. But how can anyone argue that #afc squad doesn't need strengthening?
 City 2-0 up h/t. City have dominated ten man Arsenal. When the red mist descends, home fans will see it was a penalty and rugby tackle. 
Giroud heads over Arsenal's best chance. The best thing you can say about Arsenal is they have shown resilience in the second half. 0-2
 Arsenal feel hard done by. But truth is unless they strengthen in January, can't see them finishing top 4. Gotta be some players out there 
Arteta out for three weeks. Huge blow. Arsenal need to strengthen. I pressed Wenger on this and the presser and he insists they are trying..
Refuse to believe there aren't players out there who can give Arsenal a lift in Jan. A failure to do business in Jan would be unforgivable.

Arsenal squad isn't nearly strong enough. Summer market is better time to buy. So why not sign then? To blame January market is wrong.
Mertesacker has been Arsenal's best c/half this season. Koscielny and Vermaelen do not work well as a pair. Chelsea and now City proved that
@julian_bennetts I've called fans on horrific chanting. But not sure I'd post a video of it. But our website has done the Arsenal video.

 Told around 58-59,000 tickets sold tonight. 1,000 Swansea tickets sold for £35. Arsenal fans will pay £57 for their ticket to Chelsea 
 Arsenal piling on the pressure. Walcott, Giroud and Wilshere all go close. 0-0 
 Arsenal played well, had so much pressure in the second half. But it was 0-0 in the PL game here and then Michu scored 2 late goals... 
How many more chances can Arsenal waste? Striker required in the January market.
Sagna cross so inviting for Walcott who fails to connect and Arsenal hit the post. 0-0
 Still feel Arsenal need a boost with a new signing or two. Team needs extra, dressing room needs a message of intent from the manager. #afc

Spent a few hours with Tony Adams recently. V engaging. But Arsenal can't be that bad - he made it very clear he was desperate to go back.
@kippaxcorner What on earth has agreeing with a red card for Kompany got to do with Arsenal? City would have won playing with 10 or 11.
Lots of #afc fans tweeting me saying they're paying £60 for a ticket to go to Chelsea. It's not just an Arsenal issue: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ticket-prices-are-getting-out-of-hand-1527715 …
Chelsea 2 up. Arsenal can feel aggrieved on first but surely a red card for Szczesny on 2nd. Martin Atkinson levels it up.
Arsenal used to compete in this game. Chelsea so in command in this first half it's frightening. 2-0
Walcott makes it 2-1. Great finish after Cazorla through ball. Arsenal competed this half
 Gibbs so important for Arsenal recently. Great attitude, strong performances, sets a positive tone. Surely Chelsea gotta hook Torres. 
@indykaila Be sure to tell Arsenal
 Remember how bad Boruc looked vs Arsenal? He looks good again tonight, back to old self. Lambert and Ramirez done well, too for #saintsfc

Will the real Arsenal please stand up? #afc sensational at start of second half. Enough to persuade Wenger to put his cheque book away...

More comedy defending from Arsenal. Suarez takes full advantage to put Liverpool ahead. 0-1 #lfc #afc
Arsenal are so bad defensively it's ridiculous. Suarez is destroying Arsenal. Szczesny is having the worst game I've ever seen him play.
Mancini has got his I Phone out. Maybe he's dialling 999 to get emergency help for Arsenal's help. Or seeing how much Suarez would cost.
Arsenal booed off h/t. TV cameras pan across to first Suarez and then Szczesny. The two central characters. Liverpool lead 1-0 and worth it.
Has Wenger started editing the Arsenal programme? They've printed League Table based on 1st half & 2nd half results. 12th at h/t 2nd at f/t
Liverpool will kick themselves for throwing away a two goal lead. But a point at Arsenal will surely be considered a good result.
 Liverpool strike force of Suarez & Sturridge looked dangerous. Arsenal will give thanks for Wilshere, Walcott and the ever improving Giroud 
@Agent_mb Waiting for long term targets in the summer. By which time Arsenal will not be in the Champs League
Why would Arsenal wait until summer to do all their transfer business? They'll be out of the top four by then. Surely Wenger can see that.
Love the fact the Arsenal programme has PL table after 1st half and 2nd half results. 12th at half time and 2nd after full time. #afc
Arsenal considering move for Valencienne left-back Gaetan Bong. Bong been offered to Arsenal after Gibbs ruled him out for three weeks.
 John Arne Riise available at Fulham. Why not take a punt Arsenal? Stephen Warnock been suggested, not happening. 
I'm surprised Becks has opted for Paris over training with Arsenal. There's a New Look for Posh in the business park near London Colney.
Beckham had one day training with the Arsenal squad. Wenger realised he was gonna make Santos look bad so got his mates at PSG to sign him.

@stevemyalleats @mirrorfootball Arsenal yet to unveil their secret weapon if things get really tough. Their deadly Italian Paulo Lasagne.
Walcott pace down the right vs Wilkinson is the most noticeable thing so far at Arsenal. Game still awaiting first big chance. 0-0
Finally a chance and some goal mouth action. Wilshere corner fell to Ox and smart block by Begovic. Quality keeper. Arsenal 0 Stoke 0
Arsenal 0 Stoke 0 h/t. Begovic the star of the show.
Arsenal need to pretend they are a goal down because there is no urgency about their play whatsoever and rarely is until they go behind. 0-0
 Stoke defended brilliantly. But Arsenal have also lacked ideas, invention and creativity. Very dull game. 0-0 
Referee over rules linesman and goal stands. 1-0 Arsenal
All over. Arsenal win 1-0. Podolski deflected free kick wins it. Sums it up. #afc not at their best. Stoke's only effort on target was OG.

Back in the saddle with a double header this weekend. Arsenal v Blackburn today followed by Chelsea v Brentford tomorrow. I love the FA Cup.
Cheeky grin from Bentley at the Arsenal fans giving him stick as he sits back down. Bet he gets on...
Arsenal fans seem very pleased to see him.
 Cazorla, too. Walcott and Wilshere also coming on. Arsene Wenger has blown his little trumpet and here come the Arsenal cavalry. #afc 
Cup shock on the cards klaxon. Arsenal fan Kazim-Richards scores 0-1. Blackburn only got 13 mins to hold out.
 Blackburn defended well first half, got better second half and punished Arsenal's lack of intensity. #afc been poor 
 Blackburn through, Arsenal out. Barring Champs League miracle, that's 8 years without trophy. Lack of respect for silverware 
Wenger needed that trophy. Arsenal need a trophy. Fourth not enough anymore. Shouldn't be mutually exclusive. Need silverware.
Arsenal paid heavy price for not being focused on the job in hand. Each game as it comes cliche not observed today. Blackburn heroic.
Arsenal gone eight years - going on nine - without a trophy. Last trophy? FA Cup. It doesn't take a rocket scientist...
Find it bizarre so many PL clubs rest players for trophy their fans want to win. Norwich did it last round. Arsenal did it. Will Wigan? #odd

 And if Arsenal upset Bayern, the critics can say how silly the fans are. But no trophy since 2005 is too long. Far too long. 
 Especially when Arsenal blow great opportunities against Blackburn, Bradford & even Birmingham. It's now or ever for Wenger. Time to deliver 
 There's an awful lot of Arsenal coverage in today's Daily Mirror. Proper analysis. Wilshere, Wenger, fans, stats. Go buy a copy.

 Bayern Munich fans singing   Football's coming home.   Arsenal haven't started yet. 0-2 
Bayern inches away from a third. It wouldn't have flattered them. They've been on a different level to Arsenal. #afc utterly outclassed 0-2.
Arsenal fans now chant: 'Come on Arsenal.' It's a long way back. 0-2

I'm off to Arsenal v Aston Villa. Dusting down my book of cliches to declare: it's a must win for both clubs. #afc #avfc
 There's water everywhere near 'The Bear' roundabout! Burst pipe. If you're going to Arsenal v Villa, leave early 
 Having left my Twitter feed open twice in Arsenal press room, I'm going to be more careful. Mind you, my score predictions are often wrong! 
Arsenal nervous despite the goal. Villa applying some pressure. Have keepers given up on catching the ball?
 Arsenal's passing is quite poor. They're giving possession away and adding to their own nerves. Villa doing OK, Weimann playing v well. 1-0 
 Arsenal lead 1-0 at half time. Villa been in this game. Even Wilshere's not having a great game today. Not a good game, scrappy. 
Arsenal very low key first half. Often seems they can't get going or motivate themselves until the opposition score. Leaders needed.
Clark missed a great chance for Villa. Weimann monstered Monreal first half. Arsenal must find solution or Villa will get summat. 1-0
 Giroud done OK, but he's got to attack the space, take a chance once in a while. Far too often, Arsenal have no-one in the danger zone 
 1-1 Villa, they ran through the Arsenal midfield and defence as if they weren't there. Weimann ran from half way line. 
N'Zogbia replaced by Hawkins. Can a Spurs man bury Arsenal now?
In Arsenal mixed zone. Hoping to speak to Cazorla. May have to rely on my Spanish picked up from Dora The Explorer.
Cazorla outstanding for Arsenal. Not just the 2 goals - great work rate. Wilshere looked tired but still tried. Jenkinson did very well #afc
 At a guess, there were 50,000 in the Emirates. Tickets sold made it sell-out. Arsenal need to revive their fortunes to get crowds back #afc 
@PoznanInMyPants @blackburngeorge I've watched it again. You guys talk as if every Arsenal player is No1. They're fifth for a reason. Night.
 @goonermint @jgbethell U did miss it. We've covered ticket prices extensively, not just at Arsenal. But most fans only notice their own club

 Some thoughts on @BTLifesaPitch on Arsenal, way forward for Wenger and how important this summer will be for #afc ://tinyurl.com/d2fl4gw  
 Arteta is captain tonight and should be Arsenal captain full stop, in my opinion. #afc 
0-1 Arsenal. Surely not?!?!
I never had any doubt Arsenal could do it. Obviously. #afc. Giroud the goalscorer. What a start. 0-1
0-1 #afc at h/t. My mate's a locksmith. He texted me earlier offering me and my family free locks for life if Arsenal win. Chubb or Yale?
 Wenger sarcastically claps the referee when, in his eyes, Arsenal finally get a decision. 
All over. Arsenal win 2-0 but go out. Pride restored though
 Arsenal showed plenty of pride. Defence so much more solid. Jenko's performance was boys' own stuff. Fabianski played so well. Mert, too 
 #afc Wenger can surely take pride in Arsenal's display. But for second year running, if only he had more options from the bench...

 Gruelling game and trip for Arsenal in midweek. Few bumps, bruises, tired legs, will Wenger have to make changes to refresh the batteries? 
 Arsenal team sheet. Rosicky, Ramsey have knocks. Diaby, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Monreal all in. #afcpic.twitter.com/pGLWVYFYiB 
 Bit early for a rave. But Swansea spinning some tunes to welcome the teams out at the Liberty. Arteta leads Arsenal out, Monk leads Swansea 
Wenger will be hoping Arsenal won't be victims by the end. Laudrup will be saying: do you really want to hurt me? Enough already.
 Rangel goes through but fires wide under pressure. Arsenal defence looked vulnerable, all in a line 
De Guzman booked for foul on Cazorla 0-0. Dangerous area for a free kick for Arsenal. Expect a sideways pass. #afc
Cazorla is Arsenal's busiest and liveliest player. Jenkinson swings in a cross. Giroud reacts too late. He's got to take a chance more
Michu sees low shot brilliantly saved by Fabianski. He was offside. Arsenal's defensive line being tested to the limit. Again.
 Routledge coming on for Swansea. Giroud about to come on for Arsenal. Oh, sorry, my mistake. He's already on. 
 Ramsey, Gervinho on for Arsenal. Ox, Diaby off. Ox did well. Ramsey gets dog's abuse from Swansea fans. Routledge on, Swansea going for it 
 Cazorla run forced the issue for Arsenal. Williams couldn't clear, Giroud couldn't control and Monreal pounced. 0-1 #afc 
 All over. Swansea 0 Arsenal 2. Monreal, Gervinho. Travelling Arsenal fans celebrate wildly. Huge result for Arsenal. 
All gone off at the final whistle here. Michu tries to confront Fabianski because the Arsenal keeper had run length of pitch to celebrate
 @JWTelegraph Walcott and Giroud were poor at Swansea, Arsenal's poorest players, couldn't get going. #broadsheetstirrer 
 @10akhil @jwtelegraph Hope it's a turning point then, Akhil. Arsenal lucky to have superb travelling support today. I like Swansea trips

Good to see Nigel Adkins set to return to Premier League management with Reading. Harshly treated by Saints. Set to be in charge v Arsenal.
Jovetic in the mixed zone. I'll give him an Arsenal Handbook.
#afc Wenger says recent form shows Arsenal have 'very good chance' of finishing top 4. 'We have special desire to do it'
Just to clarify... Wenger said Wilshere will be ready to play '2 weeks on Sunday.' Arsenal play Norwich on the Saturday. Mmmm...
Mind the gap. #afc Wenger convinced Arsenal can overtake #thfc Spurs and make top 4. Surely it can't happen again... ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-arsene-wenger-piles-pressure-1790343 …

Arsenal v Reading team sheet pic.twitter.com/sIf72v4KGL
 Arsenal should have had a penalty. Giroud lifted ball over Taylor, Taylor clears him out, Reading clear. How is that not a pen? 
Cazorla shot brushes the side netting. Arsenal should be out of sight here. But they're not. 1-0
Ramsey and Rosicky have played well for Arsenal today.
Arsenal fans now winging: 'we've got Gervinho.'
Podolski and Ox coming on for Arsenal. Ramsey filling in at left back. What a hero.
Penalty Arsenal
4-1 Arsenal as Arteta converts
 All over at Arsenal. Arsenal win 4-1. Arsenal excellent. Gervinho scored 2 assists, Cazorla beautiful. Reading nightmare. 
 Arsenal have momentum. Cazorla, Gervinho, Ramsey were superb. But think Spurs' win at Swansea is the bigger result. Chelsea more vulnerable 
#afc Arsenal striker Giroud sets sights on third place. Q: Are Spurs feeling the pressure? A: Yes. Plus ratings: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-4-1-reading-gunners-olivier-1795327 …

@mistercgooner You may not agree with his outlook but to suggest he's not put money into Arsenal or gaining a stake is wrong.
 @AFChymnSheet I did big column on it, highlighting prices nationwide. Perhaps as it featured other clubs beyond Arsenal you didn't notice..! 
Adkins makes his mark. Reading make 5 changes. And no wonder. They were awful last week at Arsenal. Must get some sort of reaction...
Tomas Rosicky is Arsenal's answer to Wigan. Starts playing in March.
Huge result for Arsenal yesterday. Now over to Spurs and Chelsea in the battle for top four which is developing into fascinating contest.
@Pauldavis_pfa @JordJDavis For you... RT On This Day 1980: Paul Davis made his Arsenal debut at Spurs pic.twitter.com/54id3m9zBp
@AFC_Charley Get a grip. No mention of Wigan v Stoke prices either. I praised Arsenal for 25 tickets. And highlighted other high prices
@BlackScarfAFC I was surprised last year at number of Arsenal fans who wanted Chelsea to lose CL final as it meant Spurs would qualify.
Wilshere and Walcott return to Arsenal squad. Off to Arsenal presser shortly. Can #afc pile pressure on Spurs? ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-jack-wilshere-theo-walcott-1825113 …
#afc Wenger not getting carried on Arsenal potentially being 7 clear of Spurs by next time they play. 'We just focus on ourselves.'
#afc Wenger on whether Spurs Euro exit is good for Arsenal. 'Don't mind and don't care.'
Norwich's Johnson says he's 'nasty but not dirty' after breaking Arsenal's Sagna's leg in same fixture last year ://bit.ly/1546LVq 
 #afc Wenger doesn't agree with Neville's foreign policy, AW on Arsenal's 'massive week'. Plus Wilshere returns today  ://bit.ly/1546LVq  
 @willow1886 @gooner_ak @urbanpastoral Who said it was only Arsenal? And, I have to tell you, it's only afc fans who make a fuss about it! 
 @Amir_Nuri @GNev2 Blimey, if u read Gary's tweets he actually praises Arsenal and Wenger's new policy 
I'm at Arsenal v Norwich today then at Wembley tomorrow for Chelsea v Man City. An upset in either?
Great to see Jack Wilshere back in for Arsenal today. Always want the best players to be playing. #afc
 Arsenal v Norwich team sheet. #afc #ncfc Holt and Kamara up front, Hughton releases handbrake and plays two up frontpic.twitter.com/Q8cbBQyzwC 
Arsenal well below par. Thought they'd slip up in one of these next three games. Norwich defending really well. 0-0
The fact is Arsenal have played poorly and it's up to the opposition to break a team down. No-one can have any complaints.
Ox coming on. Arsenal complaining about the referee. He can't possibly be playing as badly as them. No urgency. 0-1
Penalty Arsenal. Handball spotted by lino. Arteta taking it...
Arsenal 2-1 !!!!
Arsenal fans chanting Podolski. What a turnaround.
All over. Arsenal win 3-1. Never in doubt. Until the 89th minute.
Here's my preview on Arsenal Ladies. It's a Champions League semi final at Borehamwood at 2pm on Sun. Support them ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-ladies-boss-shelley-kerr-1829632 …
The same Arsenal fans complaining about negative Norwich are those who moan when a team goes to Old Trafford to have their tummies tickled.
Agreed officials made right decision. I may have to wait for the day Arsenal fans congratulate linesman for giving pen which referee missed.

I'm at Arsenal v Everton tonight. A must win for both sides' Champions League ambitions. Far too tight to call but Everton in great form.
 @BoxingKangaroo Good theory, somewhat incorrect. I've tweeted links to several Arsenal stories so wanted to provide balance. Only 140chars.. 
 @ChapmansTribute Get a grip, mate. My previous links were about Arsenal. So one tweet about Everton form shouldn't be seen as hell on earth. 
Arsenal v Everton team sheet pic.twitter.com/zUxjHyZWqz
Everton made the better start. Arsenal only shown glimpses. Moyes' men putting the strong arm on midfield and looking more dangerous. 0-0
Baines free kick.. Arsenal fans hold breath... Charged down
 Thought Everton were terrific, particularly first half. Midfield fought and scrapped, but the bite on Arsenal. Barkley looks great prospect. 
 Arsenal improved second half. But how Wenger must wish he had a top, top quality finisher. Giroud so often goes for power over precision. 
Made Jagielka Man of the Match. Nearly went for Barkley. Could have chosen Distin. Thought Ramsey was tireless for Arsenal. Gibbs good too.
 @Alan_Alger_ @Josh_Landy If Arsenal had a finisher they'd have won the game. Mind you, Everton would probably feel the same. 
My match report on Arsenal 0 Everton 0. Tottenham and Chelsea the big winners after stalemate. Made Jagielka my MotM ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-0-0-everton-match-report-1304787 …
 For the record, thought Everton were excellent. Arsenal could do with a bit more of their muscle and toughness in my humble opinion. 
Arsenal grew stronger as the game wore on. They became the better team second half. If only they had a centre forward who could finish...
 @paullesurf Yes, but Arsenal fans get upset when Everton and Norwich put up a struggle. 
Here's my #afc web column and THREE good reasons why I think Arsenal will spend big this summer: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/hey-big-spender-three-reasons-1839005 …
At Arsenal ahead of Wenger's pre-match press conference for Fulham. Wonder what was the first record Arsene bought?
 @ncustisTheSun @neilashton_ I'm proposing to Jack Wilshere in a tweet we're printing in the paper tomorrow. That's your Arsenal news, pal. 
#afc Wenger says Mertesacker is the glue which holds the Arsenal defence together: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fulham-vs-arsenal-per-mertesacker-1841797 …
Good to see #afc Arsenal listening to fans on ticket prices and introducing Young Guns enclosure. Junior Gunners make a comeback.
I'm off to Fulham v Arsenal. Beautiful sunshine. Got my sunglasses packed. Fulham fired up after midweek defeat. #ffc #afc
Giroud hits the post. No doubt there's a stat for that. Closest Arsenal have come. 0-0
 Arsenal 1 up. Walcott f/kick, Koscielny headed on and Mertesacker heads in 
And we're off. Wenger comes out late for 2nd half and has to jog all suited and booted past the Arsenal fans.
Arsenal have started really poorly in this 2nd half. Game far from over. Fulham still dangerous. 0-1
 Wilshere and Podolski on for Walcott and Rosicky, 71. If they don't keep the ball better then Arsenal will blow it. 0-1 
 Arsenal so flat and jaded. They've been sloppy, not played well 
Petric on for Fulham as Jol goes for what would be a deserved equaliser. Some poor Arsenal performances. Monreal given ball away so much
 All over. Arsenal got away with that big time. Mertesacker the hero. Sidwell, Giroud the villains. Koscielny MotM. 0-1 
 #afc Wenger calls for Arsenal fans to 'respect' RvP next Sunday. Not sure they'll buy that one, Arsene... ://bit.ly/ZelcUT  
Koscielny on Arsenal's perfect defensive partnership. #afc needed Koscielny & Mertesacker to be at their best at #ffc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fulham-0-1-arsenal-per-mertesacker-1845768 …

#afc Wenger calls for Arsenal fans to show RvP 'respect' and admits Jack Wilshere needs a rest. Ominous for England? ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-boss-arsene-wenger-calls-1845870 …
 Arsenal to appeal Giroud red. No, they're not hoping for game to be added for frivolous appeal... 
@deanowasthere89 Arsenal relied on him too heavily and won nothing so the squad was flawed. Man U won title with him so theirs isn't.
#cfc probe anti-semitic abuse of Benayoun. Some fans don't like him after he supported Torres & kissed Arsenal badge ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelsea-launch-anti-semitism-probe-over-1847875 …
 Mind u, it is bizarre that Arsenal don't have natural back up for their suspended c/forward. And that is down to Wenger. Money was available 
Don't let us down @wengerknowsbest I can feel an amusing 'Arsenal better than Barcelona' tweet coming on.
 To suggest RvP would get anything but booed is pie in the sky. But don't sing THAT song. After all, Arsenal fans don't like a Wenger song. 
But the rivalry dynamic has always been Arsenal/Tottenham. That's the one and always will be for many fans.
 Here's a column from year ago. You can leave Robin, but ask Arsenal fans for permission... And Brady & Stapleton etc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/the-arsenal-column-why-robin-van-persie-837080 … 
 @SouthernGoliath Absolutely, but Arsenal fans seem to have. Want it both ways. 
@vinnysmith67 @SSNSpursEmma Agreed. But Arsenal fans seem to have
@thegmanN17 I agree with you. Campbell far worse. And yet Arsenal fans think that deal was ok but RvP out of order. Double standards.
 RT: @JamieDalton82: Bild on Rene Adler/Arsenal ://bit.ly/15KC1tu  >> Thanks, Jamie. Good to see them following up English press 
Off to Arsenal v Manchester United later to observe the guard of honour. And a football match may break out later. #afc #mufc
 But hope Arsenal fans don't cross the line on RvP. We expect boos, stick and jeers. But cheers from Man United fans. What a player. 
Be good to see Podolski start up front for Arsenal. That would be a big opportunity for a highly talented player to show his true class #afc
Here come Arsenal who line up either side of tunnel to give #mufc guard of honour
 RvP last out. Loud cheers from Man U fans, boos from Arsenal. I saw about two Arsenal fans turn their back. That was a non event. #afc #mufc 
Lovely RvP cross for Jones and he headed wide. Should have been 1-1. A gift of a chance. Arsenal 1 Man United 0
 RvP booked for late challenge on Mertesacker. Mert was glowing about RvP before the game, said Arsenal players voted for him as PotY. 
Terrific save from Szczesny to deny RvP at point blank range. Rosicky and Ramsey played very well for Arsenal. 1-0
 Wilshere coming on for Rosicky. Blimey, thought Rosicky had been Arsenal's best player. 
All over 1-1. Arsenal not quite good enough. Awful by Sagna. Ruthless brilliance by RvP. Arsenal played well but United had more chances.
 Not for the first time, an Arsenal v Man United game ends in lots of talk about the post match grub. #pizzagate 
@AlexStone7 Perfect for Arsenal!
Champs Lge place no longer in Arsenal's hands. If Spurs win all their games (inc Chelsea) and Chelsea win the other 3 then Arsenal miss out

Roberto Martinez should put out the stiffs and the kids in the FA Cup final and save his first team for Arsenal. Final should be last game.
 @WarrenHaughton He should rest players for a bigger game, the game at Arsenal. 
And here's a major Arsenal exclusive story. Kit deal agreed with Puma. It will be biggest in English football. #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-agree-puma-kit-deal-1874661 …
 Industry figures blown away by figures involved. On top of Emirates sponsorship, Arsenal have struck a fantastic deal. Major praise required 
 On a huge day of football stories, Arsenal's Puma deal is No1 most read on @mirrorfootball site. Thanks very much. Good to feel appreciated. 
@jonawils I imagine you don't like the half time cakes at Arsenal. Bet they go all squidgy in your pockets...
 @honigstein Mind you, you did tell me Podolski wasn't joining Arsenal 
@honigstein We had a conversation in the Arsenal press room and you said no chance. It was before the German media had picked up on it.
 @honigstein We can't know it all, Rafa. No shame in that. One of your tweets suggested Arsenal watching Reus not Podolski. 
Second most read story on the entire @DailyMirror site is Arsenal's kit deal with Puma. No1 story was Amanda Berry. Thanks for reading.
 At Chelsea v Tottenham. Huge, huge, huge game for THREE London clubs. Chelsea win and they're in top 4. Spurs win massive blow to Arsenal.

 Benayoun shouldn't have kissed the Arsenal badge while on loan. But if the abuse runs deeper, then shame on you... Don't boo your own either 
@GeoffArsenal I don't think Arsenal will win both their remaining games. Then it could be up to others. Chelsea looked shattered tonight.
 @GeoffArsenal Chelsea looked dead in last 20. A big worry. Just think Spurs will do it. Arsenal's results good, but not been playing great. 
@MERCY_ARSENAL @kevsat1 Thanks. My predictions often wrong anyway! Think people confuse what I predict with what they think I want to happen
 If I'm not mistaken it was @JohnDillonExprs who asked:   David, if an Arsenal Lego team played a Spurs Lego team, who would win?   
Arsenal make move for hero keeper Manuel Almunia. Lots of love on here from people who used to batter him.
Encouraging news for Arsenal. Alan Pardew said he wouldn't mind if they lost 4-0 next week. Think he meant as long as Newcastle played well.

 Arsenal started like a train, encouraged by Podolski opener. Then Wigan came back and thoroughly deserved Maloney leveller. H/t 1-1 
Arteta subbed and heads straight down the tunnel. Worrying for Arsenal if he's injured. #afc

Was at Pardew presser when he said about not caring if they lost 4-0 to Arsenal. He meant as long as Newcastle played well.
I'm making my way to Newcastle v Arsenal and it's North London v North East for 4th place today. Home banker for #thfc so over to you #afc
Koscielny Arsenal's main man. Headed narrowly wide at one end and put off Cisse from scoring goal at the other. Tight. 0-0
 Arsenal not playing very well, Newcastle doing OK. Tense. 0-0 
 Just sent my half time update on ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/premier-league-live-follow-ten-1898242 … Arsenal not been great, Newcastle doubled up on Walcott, curbed his threat. 0-0

 Half time. 3-0 to Olivier Giroud, er, sorry Arsenal. 3 super finishes. He's certainly responding to competition 
Lots of Arsenal subs warming up at half time. Jack Wilshere out there but not changed yet #afc
Here comes Wilshere for Oxlade-Chamberlain #afc 65 gone. Arsenal lead 6-0

Think a few missing point on bid being rejected. Will Arsenal go back? Will Suarez accept it if his camp believe clause entitles him to go?
@MattHughesTimes What an absolute joke. No-one at Arsenal thinks they can't get him. The offer has been made with genuine hope/expectation.
@MattHughesTimes Maybe. But Real Madrid not come in yet and will they pay £40m? Not sure. At least Arsenal showing they mean business.
 Arsenal found it impossible to keep RvP last summer. And he reported back for pre-season, too. It may be the same for Liverpool. 
Suarez to tell Liverpool he wants to go Arsenal. #lfc put £50m price tag on his head but #afc increasingly hopeful://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-transfer-news-liverpool-admit-2086361 …

 One good thing for me to look forward to... On @talkSPORTKO shortly to discuss Arsenal's tour, Suarez and more. Join me from Tokyo 
Will Suarez happen? My view is it all comes down to that clause and if the player acts up. Players have acted up with Arsenal and been sold.
And maybe Liverpool will see how much stick Arsenal got over RvP (a similarly impossible position) and decide it's not worth it. Fair play.
 Interesting #afc debates tonight. But are people really suggesting Arsenal have bid for Suarez without Wenger approval? Come on, be serious. 
 Arsenal won't budge on £40,000,001 for Suarez (at least not yet) as it's all about the clause. Could go to the wire ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenals-luis-suarez-transfer-bid-2102816 … 
QPR's former Arsenal defender Traore set for Moscow switch #afc #qpr ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/armand-traore-set-qpr-departure-2104589 …
In every piece I've written I've said Liverpool are adamant the clause won't work. It's still going to be hard for Arsenal to get Suarez.
But a bit naive to suggest Arsenal didn't add on the £1 without encouragement and for a reason.
 Bernard's agent played a blinder. Linked the player with Arsenal who were never interested, according to Wenger, and now draws out Shakhtar. 
 And Bernard forever becomes an Arsenal target. Even though he wasn't. PS. Whatever happened to good Brazilian names? Bernard, Fred, Jo... 
 At Premier League race night. Just done my predicted table. Torn between Chelsea and Man City but gone Jose. Man U 3rd, Arsenal 4th 
@DJTayo I'm not sure 'throwing your toys out of the pram' should be encouraged. But I guess justification is that others did it to Arsenal.
@daraobriain Arsenal had bid 40m when last pressed about a lack of signings. 'We're trying etc.' But nxt presser it will be harder to defend
Here's my view on Arsenal's transfer window so far (or lack of it). Blame game has begun. Pressure on #afc to deliver ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenals-summer-transfer-window-far-2112190 …
 Saw Sol Campbell at a launch earlier. How Arsenal, England and, dare I say it, Spurs could do with him now. Huge character in every sense. 
Had superb reaction to my piece on Arsenal's transfer business this summer (or lack of it). Thanks for reading #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenals-summer-transfer-window-far-2112190 …
 @timpayton Oh crikey, Liverpool fans only use foul language in their abuse, hope Arsenal aren't about to get physical... 
 George Graham on @sportsbreakfast   I've got every confidence there will be 3 or 4 new signings at Arsenal.   * 
Arsenal make a new signing. The Running Man will be at the Emirates Cup this weekend via @sincs1980 #afc ://bit.ly/15Amgmy 
 So Wenger confirms Arsenal not given up on Suarez if they can find an   amicable   solution with Liverpool. Cue bucket load of #lfc abuse. 
 RT @MattDunnExpress Wenger insists Suarez must fit in with Arsenal's traditions. He wants him to become a homeless alcoholic >>V harsh, Matt 
 I think Suarez will look at legal recourse next week and see where that leads. Liverpool adamant they won't sell, Arsenal not giving up. 
 @piersmorgan Arsenal quietly confident. Suarez determined to force the issue, more resolute than ever. An interesting combination. 
Are Arsenal back in for Ashley Williams to ease defensive worries? They watched him for Swansea vs Malmo on Thursday ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-ashley-williams-back-2118650 …
Small one: The Sun also say Arsenal agreed £6.1m deal for Matthias Ginter. Hope that happens as Mirror Sport first reported that interest.
Come on. What's the booing of Higuain all about? Hardly his fault Arsenal didn't value him as highly as Napoli or Real Madrid. Get over it.
2-1 Porto. Napoli's Fernandez own goal. It's all up for grabs as we stand. This result suits Arsenal ahead of another Emirates Cup assault..
Wenger castigated me on Friday for not showing enough faith in Sanogo. If he can follow the Anelka route... Arsenal can win Emirates Cup now
 Arsenal on course to win the Emirates Cup. Book the open top bus and town hall. Seriously, they've looked better and sharper today. 1-0 
Arsenal top the Emirates Cup table with 7. Porto 2nd on 6.
Drogba awesome striker - and he always scores against the Arsenal. Still gives Senderos nightmares. Best of his type in his day in the world
 All over. No Emirates Cup this year. Trophy awarded to Didier Drogba. Galatasaray 9 pts, Porto 6, Arsenal 4 Napoli 4

 Quite apart from Suarez, been reassured Arsenal working on other business. They're determined to do business and show they mean business. 
@talkSPORTDrive They've clearly been told what to bid. Levy rightly lauded as tough negotiator. Arsenal do it and they're classless. Weird.
 @arseblog We'd be here all day with that one!! Last year it was Arsenal fans over RvP, now Liverpool fans over Suarez. Charming. 
 @Matt_Lawton_DM @talkSPORTDrive @charliesale @liamdfisher Sorry, only just saw Ade's tweet...! Arsenal 0 Tottenham 26 etc 
 Luis Suarez confirms he wants out of Liverpool, insists clause is valid and appears up for Arsenal. Backs up everything we've been saying. 
 No, it's not RvP a year ago but Luis Suarez now. I suspect Arsenal fans may forgive Suarez more readily. But very unsavoury all round. 
 But let's not kid ourselves. Arsenal dancing with the devil (or even Dracula). Suarez saga is as ugly as Cesc, Nasri, RvP. And then some. 
And of course if Real Madrid came in late... But only Suarez bidders at the moment are Arsenal. Watch this space.
Be careful what you wish for. Why the Suarez saga probably seems painfully familiar for Arsenal fans #afc #lfc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/luis-suarez-transfer-arsenal-fans-2134276 …

 Let's be honest, that's the message most Arsenal fans wanted from Wenger with RvP and Man United. Fair play to Liverpool and Rodgers. 
@Tommy__75 @JohnBrewinESPN @legsidelizzy I was doing my job: reporting Arsenal's interest in a player like I reported MU's interest in RvP
 I've stated in every single piece that Liverpool don't agree and dispute it. But it's why Arsenal bid £40,000,001. It's a story. 
@daz2211 In every single piece I stated Liverpool refusing to sell & dispute clause. I also reported what remains true: Arsenal want him
 About as hard as it can get for Arsenal against Fenerbahce. Ah well, at least there's a new striker to lead the line. #sanogo 
 All I've ever said is Arsenal want Suarez, Suarez wants to leave, Liverpool don't want to sell. All of that remains true #afc #lfc Goodnight 
 @Jay_78_ Boom tweet was because everything I'd written was right. Arsenal want him, he wants to go, Liverpool don't want to sell. All true 
@DarrenArsenal1 Fair play. Abuse levels put me off looking. Some Arsenal saddos joined in by retweeting a THREE YEAR OLD tweet on Koscielny!

Arsenal are certainly trying but will going for another striker who has been told he's not for sale bring more frustration? #afc #lfc #mufc
Arsenal had interest in Gustavo but say ultimately they didn't pursue it. Wenger said Bendtner isn't fit(despite training with the reserves)
Arsenal certainly not given up on Suarez. Watch developments. But not sure if Rooney would be much easier.... #afc remain in the market.
@IanDoyleSport I agree. I think the worry is that Arsenal have spent so long pursuing Suarez (and still do) do they miss out on others...?
 At Arsenal v Aston Villa. Hard to know which club has got more feelgood factor now. #afc need to buy, Villa kept Benteke. Love opening day. 
 Fancy 1-1 draw at Arsenal today. Arsenal, half an eye on Fenerbahce, Villa gave them 2 hard games last season. Tricky ://bit.ly/1cB4I03

Seems like I've been in the Fenerbahce press room for three days and still an hour until the Arsenal press conference starts. Amuse me pls
 Fair play to Wenger. He took all the questions we fired at him. Spurs are spending, why aren't Arsenal? Cabaye? And is it poor preparation? 
 Good answers with a feel of: trust me, we'll get it right, we'll get through and seemed incredulous at the thought of Spurs catching Arsenal 
We'll see. His answer that 75pc of deals are done in the last fortnight is no excuse and as convincing as Arsenal's preparations thus far.

Arsenal's 'escalation of financial firepower' should surely see them going for tried and trusted keepers rather than take a punt again.
Saving grace could be Fenerbahce could yet get CL K/O. UEFA showing a touch of Arsenal's transfer dealings about their disciplinary process.
 But without question, every single club that Arsenal wants to do business with has either snubbed them and or demanded unrealistic fees. 
Hot here in Istanbul. Is going to get a lot hotter for Arsenal later. But remember 6th play-off in 8 years. It's 100 per cent record so far.
Arsenal starting XI strong. Should - and I stress should - be enough to go through. It's the depth of the squad and bench which worries.
400 Arsenal fans have made the trip to Turkey via all manner of places. Sensational support. But they'll do well to be heard tonight.
If only Arsenal had a striker to give them a cutting edge... 0-0
Arsenal no luck with injuries at all at the moment. Koscielny off with cut head after Webo kicked him in the face. Jenkinson on. Sagna c/b
 Well, that's why Arsenal need a striker. Arsenal have dominated but no end product. Ramsey, Rosicky and Wilshere played well. 0-0 h/t 
The other thing which strikes me is how bad Fenerbahce are. If Arsenal can't beat them...
0-1 Arsenal lead in Turkey. Gibbs scores after great work by Ramsey and Walcott. Thoroughly deserved. #afc
Penalty Arsenal.
0-3 Arsenal. Giroud converts. So he does know where the net is... #afc
My match report and ratings from Fenerbahce 0 Arsenal 3. Ramsey MotM. Terrific #afc win and resilience under pressure://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/fenerbahce-0-3-arsenal-gunners-cruise-2203471 …

Arsenal go for Real Madrid striker Benzema. What a signing that would be. But will they sell? Still want Cabaye #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-karim-benzema-target-2202731 …
 And as I retweeted earlier, German press suggesting Podolski could be on way out. If Arsenal could get top replacement, am sure they'd do it 
The ever reliable (and entertaining) @BumperGraham confirming that Real Madrid briefing that there has been an Arsenal approach for Benzema.

 Arsenal leading 3-1, Giroud has scored, Podolski has scored, the new striker Sanogo is on. What's all the fuss about?!?! 
Just filed my assessment on Arsenal's win at Fulham for @mirrorfootball blog ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fulham-v-arsenal-live-score-2215450 … And you can follow all the games there..

A few Arsenal back-up options in here. Cabaye seems closest but they need a striker to really light the fires... ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-arsenal-transfers-luis-suarez-2212447 …
@MickTheGooner He had a bad game. But he got the penalties right. But there's no way the PL sit and think 'Let's pick a bad ref for Arsenal'
@MickTheGooner You also forget: there was more anger/hysteria on Twitter from Arsenal fans towards Wenger/club before papers hit streets!
Arsenal deal for Cabaye is close with his representatives discussing switch. Bigger targets also in sights... #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsene-wenger-blames-media-brainwashing-2221256 …

Off to England squad announcement at Wembley then Arsenal v Fenerbahce tonight. Centre halves the key for England. Which is best pairing?
Can Arsenal pull off a sensational deal for a Real Madrid star? Watch my @MirrorFootball video here:://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/karim-benzema-arsenal-john-cross-2228519 …
Arsenal team as expected. Wilshere and Monreal the changes. Should be easy street. Fenerbahce poor. #afc remarkable record in Champs League.
1-0 Ramsey. If there's one Arsenal player who deserves a goal as a reward for recent displays it's Ramsey. Magnificent.
 Arsenal's new striker steps forward, ready to come on... Yes, it's free transfer Yaya Sanogo. 
 Arsenal, having used all three subs, now have Wilshere down injured. How long does the injury list have to be before Wenger spends? 
Here's my 1st report for @mirrorfootball on Arsenal 2 Fenerbahce 0. Wenger on Mata & rewrite with quotes coming soon ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-2-0-fenerbahce-ramsey-double-2231419 …
 Wenger far more coy when asked whether Mata's father, who is also his agent, was a guest of Arsenal in directors' box. Very intriguing... 
I can picture Arsenal hierarchy plying Mata snr with wine & canapes.. Don't forget many at Arsenal thought Mata deal was done 2 years ago...
 Here's my rewrite on Arsenal 2 Fenerbahce 0. Wenger on injuries, transfers and qualification not enough #afc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-2-0-fenerbahce-ramsey-double-2231419 … 
 And here's Wenger on Mata. Was his father a guest of Arsenal? Wenger:   No. I don't know. Maybe.   Naive to dismiss it. ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-chelseas-juan-mata-2231691 …

Theo Walcott says: Bring on Tottenham. We fancy our chances against anyone. The Arsenal winger in the mood for Sunday ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/north-london-derby-arsenals-walcott-2234189 …
 Group of Death for Arsenal. Dortmund, Marseille and Napoli. Still, at least Wenger has all those new signings... #Higuain 
 @philmcnulty Yes, chuck in free agents Sol Campbell, Jens Lehmann, Robert Pires and Francis Jeffers and Arsenal can go all the way. 
Do I think Bendtner will play for Arsenal's first team again? Doubt it. Wenger being nice. What else would he say?
 Shall we all play that embarrassing North London derby game about how few Arsenal players would get in a combined Spurs, Arsenal XI? 
Then wait for the end of the season and watch Arsenal prove everyone wrong by finishing above Spurs to show they've got a stronger squad.
I've made a fool of myself in the past thinking Spurs would finish above Arsenal. If Arsenal don't buy then surely Spurs will finally do it.
 Wenger is refusing to panic. He'll leave that to the Arsenal fans. If Spurs win on Sunday, then surely even Wenger must realise fans unhappy 
@talkSPORTDrive Ha ha. I'm sure it's Arsenal related! It made me laugh as a toilet plunger is about the level of my DIY expertise.
 Pressure is on Wenger to spend, spend, spend. Can they pull off deal for Draxler? Lots of Arsenal targets in the mix ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-arsenal-move-2239578 … 
 @ConorHadley Arsenal bid for him. I reported it. Funnily enough, I think that's a story. Why people put rumours round now is bizarre. Night. 
RT @MirrorFootball: Arsenal have a stronger squad than Spurs insists Arsene Wenger ://mirr.im/1dzkk4E  >> Really? Views?
 Is Wenger right? Are Arsenal still stronger than Spurs? For all the Spurs love-in, lots of untried players in the PL. But Arsenal no depth. 
What strikes me is that Arsenal's bench so weak. No scope to change a game. That could be vital. Few will be surprised to see me tip Spurs.
Arsenal have a really good starting XI. But a great weakness is not being able to change a game because of a poor bench and weak squad.
 Obituary in Arsenal Remembers in programme. Derek Gendler, a fan for 70 years. Was lucky to have known him for 25. Condolences. Proper gent. 
 Comes to something when I'm too busy to tweet. Shaping up to be a remarkable deadline day. If deals come off, Arsenal fans will be v happy. 
 Arsenal move for Mesut Ozil. Ready to do it either permanently or on LOAN. Not done yet, other clubs also in. #afc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-mesut-ozil-target-2244418 … 
Arsenal not only in just for Palermo keeper - but Abel Hernandez too. Also enquired about Demba Ba. #afc #cfc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-mesut-ozil-target-2244418 …
 2 years ago supermarket sweep at Primark. Now Harrods. Arsenal in for Ozil, Di Maria, Draxler, Hernandez, Viviano, Ba ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-mesut-ozil-target-2244418 … 
 Mind you, he did joke that he's been telling me that all summer... Busy day ahead for Arsenal on deadline day... #afc

I'm hearing Mesut Ozil is agreed and done to Arsenal as a permanent deal. #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/transfer-deadline-day-live-follow-2244693 …
 Ozil had been reluctant to come to Arsenal. They've persuaded him. It's all on. Imagine Ozil central, Cazorla left. Wow. #afc 
 Ozil agreed, Viviano agreed. Arsenal still in the market for more... #afc 
We broke the news of Arsenal in for Ozil on August 21. Been so many targets this summer. But this guy is world class. Signing of the summer.
Arsenal still in for a striker. Demba Ba and Abel Hernandez were two names yesterday. Ba's fitness and if Chelsea will sell is the key. #afc
 But Demba Ba very much on Arsenal's agenda now on a season long loan. Great coverm back-up, competition. Wenger wanted him in January. #afc 
 As we told u this morning, Arsenal in for Ba. Talks ongoing. Will #cfc loan to a rival? #afc want to do deal despite obvious medical issues. 
 Lots of tweets saying Chelsea loaned Benayoun to Arsenal. Sadly, I think that was designed to weaken a rival rather than strengthen... 
Arsenal not the only club in for Ba. he's had offers from Germany and former club West Ham this summer. Interesting dilemma for Ba and #cfc
German media now reporting what we told you much earlier - Mesut Ozil on his way to Arsenal. #donedeal
Arsenal to announce Mesut Ozil shortly. They're still working on Demba Ba. Hoping to agree deal. Time for one more...? #afc
Here's my @MirrorFootball video with the latest on Arsenal's incredible deal for Mesut Ozil #afc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-latest-news-mesut-2246074 …
Arsenal have done the second biggest deal in English football history. I think that answers the ambition question. Ozil genuine world class.
 They've also signed Viviano, an Italian international keeper. And they're still trying on Ba. What a 24 hours for Arsenal. #afc 
Struggle to believe Bendtner to Palace is dependent on Arsenal signing a striker. Bendtner is a million miles from Arsenal's first team.
 @GaryLineker Completely agree that Arsenal need a striker to cover for Giroud. Sadly, that's no longer in Bendtner's job description. 
 Sadly for Arsenal, Ba not happening. Chelsea don't want him to join a rival. After signing Ozil, Arsenal are a title tival IMO. #afc #cfc 
That's it now for Arsenal. Don't expect anything else. Viviano and Ozil represents a big day for #afc. Ozil among top 10 players in world
 Mesut Ozil CONFIRMED. He's issued a statement.   I'm looking forward to my future in the Premier League and at Arsenal.   
What a signing. Mesut Ozil joins Arsenal. £42m. Arsene Wenger goes from transfer window ditherer to genius in the space of 24 hours. #afc
Mesut Ozil turned down bigger offer from PSG to join Arsenal. Why? Because of the Wenger factor. Keep the faith #afc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-mesut-ozil-turned-2246564 …

 To see Arsenal fans on Twitter say Ozil is the most exciting deal since Bergkamp sums it up. A statement of intent, ambition and desire #afc 
 Yes, Arsenal should have signed a striker. But anyone who can't appreciate Ozil should go off to swim in a sea of negativity. #worldclass

The question about Arsenal is whether it's a weak squad or an injury crisis. 7 full internationals and a French under-21 out injured tonight
 Arsenal have a strong starting XI. Very strong defensive options, big midfield injuries and no back-up for the in-form Giroud. So a mix IMO

 Wenger said that was the best Arsenal played since beating Barcelona (Feb 2011). Personally, I think first half was best since Invincibles. 
 Arsenal had it won by half time. And, in true @wengerknowsbest style, Wenger admitted they were a bit   handbrakeish   in the second half.

Crisis over. Arsenal go five points clear. Two cracking goals by Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey. Some people have lost their heads this week
 For every Mike Dean there's a Martin Atkinson, Arsenal fans. 
Thought Liverpool would get a result today. Arsenal thoroughly deserved it. Arsenal's quality in midfield was the overwhelming factor.
 There has to be a big difference between   can   Arsenal win the title and   will   they win it. Of course Arsenal can win it. Playing so well.

About to head over to Dortmund's stadium for pre-match press conferences. Huge game for Arsenal. Westfalenstdion must inspire not intimidate
Arsenal look strong. Only thing is missing is Walcott pace on the break. Dortmund without Hummels makes them slightly weaker. Predictions?
If Arsenal get a draw here in Dortmund then they will have done well. Defeat and you're relying on other results for the rest of the Group.
One final thought - Arsenal away support is always sensational. They are singing their hearts out and making great noise.

15 min delay to kick off at Arsenal
 Arsenal 1-0 Giroud. Assist by Boruc, shocking mistake as he got caught in possession 
Arsenal lead and had some lovely chances but Southampton been better team IMO. Jay Rodriguez been outstanding. 1-0
Penalty to Arsenal
Arsenal not been at their best while Southampton have given them a big test. But credit to Arsenal who have dug in to earn the points.
I thought Southampton played well but not enough cutting edge today. Arsenal ground out the victory and deserved it with their resilience.
@alanwayne1975 I thought Arsenal deserved the win overall. But even Wenger gave Southampton a lot of credit
Arsenal deserved the win today. Find it odd why some can't give Southampton credit. They played their part and Arsenal had to be good to win

 A few thoughts on why Ozil needs a big game, Ramsey and the fans and why Arsenal must win their Group #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenals-mesut-ozil-needs-prove-2852193 … 
@Arselona Completely agree with that. Arsenal miss him as much as anyone.
 In 1st game at Marseille, Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs produced one of the best displays in Champs Lge this season. Definitely a World Cup chance. 
Monreal and Rosicky in for Arsenal. Gibbs is ill. Rosicky replaces Cazorla. #afc
 Arsenal strong in midfield. This is how UEFA think they'll line up. Marseille rest Thauvin, Fanni, Valbuena pic.twitter.com/C9xZn2B82N 
 The Marseille line-up has taken the French media by surprise. Unrecognisable from their predicted line-ups. Arsenal should win, basically. 
 Come on, Arsenal. That midfield of Flamini, Ramsey, Wilshere, Rosicky and Ozil looks awesome. Big night. Big performances required. 
Arsenal in control - but need another goal to be sure. Wilshere been outstanding. Ozil needs a goal after that penalty. 1-0 h/t #afc
 Arsenal win 2-0. The king, Jack Wilshere, is back. Great MotM performance. Two stunning goals. And yet Arsenal's place still not assured. 
 #afc Wenger says it's   quite incredible   that Arsenal yet to qualify and loves the goals rivalry between Wilshere and Ramsey

This is not just about sleeves. It's about tradition. The fact Arsenal has a boss and players who respect that is something to be proud of.
@Gooner_AK I think the last thing a great club like Arsenal needs is rude people like you trying to play historian. Gives bad impression.

Odemwingie coming on for Cardiff. Cardiff really giving Arsenal a torrid time. 0-1
Arsenal back in control again after Cardiff's excellent start to the second half. Still need a second goal as Cardiff never give up. 0-1
 Arsenal lead 2-0. Ozil has set up both goals. And done little else. But then again, you probably don't need to. Great finish Flamini. 
Arsenal 3-0. Ramsey again. And no celebration. Arsenal have thoroughly deserved this. But for 10 mins after h/t they have totally dominated.
Arsenal 7 points clear. People might have to start taking them seriously soon.
 All over. Huge win for Arsenal. Puts pressure on the rest. Ramsey 2, Flamini. Great finishes. 
Cardiff - what terrific fans. Mertesacker last to leave as he milks the magnificent Arsenal fans chanting BFG
Huge day so far for Arsenal. Surely Chelsea and Man City won't slip up? Otherwise people will have to find new reasons why #afc can't win it

 Personally, I'd have started with Walcott. But then I'm not Arsenal's most successful post war manager. 
Very few Arsenal fans are in the stadium. Clearly buses haven't got them there in time. Shocking that hooligans ruin it for everyone.
The kick off should be delayed to allow the Arsenal fans to get to the game. A disgrace that they lose out.
Arsenal fans pouring in the ground now
 When the draw was made, Arsenal would have bitten your hand off to qualify. But it now seems very disappointing to finish second.

 @deanowasthere89 Game is all about opinions. I didn't think Arsenal played well in Napoli. If you read what Mertesacker said, neither did he

 Few mind games going on yesterday. Think Arsenal will have a strong line-up, couple of injuries, bit of rest and rotating but most are fine. 
 So after all of Wenger's bluffing yesterday, Arsenal team lines up exactly as I filed to the paper. Arsenal should be strong enough to win. 
Anyone know what time the Arsenal game kicks off?
5 mins of injury time to make up for all the time Cardiff wasted. Pretty sure Arsenal would agree to halving that...
 Wow. Busy day today. Bendtner heroics, ecstasy and agony, Solskjaer story unfolding, Arsenal stay top, Cardiff so close to remarkable result 
Wenger said afterwards Bendtner out for three weeks. Ozil could play on Saturday. Not sure who will be more tired: Arsenal or Spurs...!

Here's my #afc web column on what Arsenal might do in the January transfer window ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-transfer-window-preview-opportunity-2980353 …
 Berbatov to Arsenal has become something of an urban myth in the past two weeks. Wenger again dismissive.   He's not a name we've considered' 
 Rumours that former Arsenal, Buckingham Town and Bishop's Stortford striker Christopher Wreh is back training at the club can't be confirmed 
Bookies Ladbrokes cut Spurs' odds to win from 3/1 to 11/4 and Arsenal go to evens from 10/11. Draw remains 5/2. #afc #thfc Too close to call
 Arsenal in for Diego Costa? That will cost you £145m, says Wenger #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenals-diego-costa-transfer-arsene-2984160 … 
 @Matt_Law_DT Ha ha, Villa youth team...? Or have Arsenal signed them? 
 Nearly nine years since Arsenal won a trophy. What a trophy? The FA Cup. See, Arsene? It does count. The FA Cup is magical. 
 Great memories of Arsenal v Spurs in the cup down the years. 1987 in the League Cup, Spurs and Gazza in 1991, Arsenal's 1993 revenge. 
 I do think teams should go for it in the FA Cup. Can't afford to rest players. Arsenal resting Szczesny today. Bad call, in my opinion. 
Remember meeting Garth Crooks just after he'd scored winner for Spurs v Arsenal in 3rd round in early 80s. He was so nice to me. Top man.
 @mikeparry8 Got to be honest, more remember Neville Southall once defying Arsenal on his own. Best keeper I ever saw. 
Arsenal win 2-0. Cazorla and Rosicky. Thought Gnabry and Rosicky excellent. Spurs were catching Arsenal - but they're now going backwards.
Spurs were gaining fast on Arsenal. Today felt like they'd rewound 5/6 years. Back to old dominance. One-off due to injuries or big shift?
 i thought Rosicky was sensational, one of his best games in an Arsenal shirt. What a season he's having. 
@deanowasthere89 @HeartOfTheHolte I got dog's abuse from Arsenal fans for suggesting Spurs had been closing the gap (before this season).

 @AntMcD7 Partly, I think. Spurs missing a lot. But Arsenal flooded midfield. Rosicky ran the show 
@david_don73thfc @MarcSpurs I think you'll find that I battered Arsenal fans for being hypocritical over RvP chants. I'm sure u read that...
Theo Walcott ruled out for six months. via @Arsenal

Transfer poker clearly being played on Alvaro Morata. He'd be a perfect loan deal for Arsenal. #afc
 @legsidelizzy @aniskumar_uk There's actually a big account there dedicated to outing me as being anti-Arsenal. All about perception, Lizzy.. 
Another reason I think Arsenal's focus is on a centre forward now rather than midfield/wideman is quite simple: Julian Draxler in summer.

Bright and early Arsenal press conference today ahead of Coventry FA Cup tie. Be interesting to see who is starting. #afc
 #afc Wenger   feels guilty   for having no transfer news. Plus Arsenal boss on team news and Coventry ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-arsene-wenger-3053982#.UuEXaBBFD4Y … 
   I was at home - you can check with my wife,   said Wenger denying reports he went to Spain on Weds night. Arsenal remain keen on Draxler. 
Superb support for Coventry's protest in the 31st minute to signify how far they have to travel. Arsenal fans applaud. Great solidarity.
 Zelalem, at 16, makes his debut. First player to play for Arsenal to be born AFTER Arsene Wenger took charge. 17 on Sunday. 
On Talksport shortly to talk Draxler and an Arsenal FA Cup win...

 But Wenger then went on to say   we don't rule it out   about Draxler. Stand by your beds Arsenal fans... 
 Arsenal closing in on Draxler but fee yet to be agreed. However, seems as if they're not far away... #afc #draxler://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/julian-draxler-arsenal-transfer-30million-3059559 … 
 No Draxler update from me. I don't think a fee/deal agreed yet. Arsenal still trying to get it done in January. Emphasise word   trying  . 
 At Arsenal press conference awaiting Arsene Wenger. Julian Draxler bingo, anyone? How many mentions. I'll have 423 in the sweep 
 #afc Wenger says Arsenal still trying to secure Sagna and he remains   fully committed   to the club 
Big Arsenal online community... When we broke Puma kit deal in May it got more hits than Fergie retiring on same day ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-agree-puma-kit-deal-1874661 …
 Arsenal CEO Gazidis speaks passionately about this deal being a   vindication   of the club's path. Exciting times for #afc 
Make no mistake. This is a huge deal for Arsenal. Their changing financial firepower means they can compete on every level. #puma #afc
 Every Arsenal fan, however, will be hoping that Puma go easy on the skin tight shirts... 
 Gazidis asked question if he'd welcome Arsenal wearing a onesie kit. Seriously.   If Mertesacker and Arteta feel comfortable in a onesie...   
My understanding is the Arsenal deal with Puma is worth £30m a year and is over 5 years. Worth £150m in total. Biggest in UK.
 Having lost Theo Walcott to injury (hugely important player to squad), I think Arsenal will regret it if they don't do a deal in January. 
 At Chelsea for Mourinho press conference than down to Southampton v Arsenal. Seconds out, mind games round three 
 Down on South coast for Southampton v Arsenal. Awful weather. Rain and freezing temperatures. Saints missing a few, Arsenal need a win. 
Traffic so bad it's even held up the Arsenal team bus (one to get the office worried).
 Don't worry, all ok... Huge game for Arsenal and chance to turn up heat on title rivals. Is there life for Southampton after Saint Nicola? 
 Arsenal been absolutely awful. Southampton excellent, fully deserve their half time lead. 1-0 
 My match report on Southampton 2 Arsenal 2. I thought Southampton deserved to win, Arsenal got away with it. ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/southampton-2-2-arsenal-match-report-3024118#.Uug7VvlFD4Y … 
Szczesny bailed Arsenal out at the end with two top saves. But thought Lallana and Shaw were different class for Southampton.
Southampton deserved to win in my opinion. Thought they played v well. Arsenal awful first half. Slightly better 2nd half but Saints v good
 Match report on Southampton 2 Arsenal 2. #afc very poor apart from six minutes, Southampton deserved to win ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/southampton-2-2-arsenal-match-report-3024118#.UujSGX-QGSM … 
 One man makes final decision on transfers at Arsenal and that's Arsene Wenger. Therefore, everything comes down to him. Stop blaming others. 
Arsenal pulled off the deal of last summer when they signed Ozil. Worth remembering that. The deal as much as the player lifted the club.
#afc Arsenal desperately trying to push through a beat-the-deadline deal on Julian Draxler. And he's keen to come. ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-julian-draxler-deal-3090314#.UumCAPlFD4Y …
I've had lots of replies tonight on Mirko Vucinic joining Arsenal. Arsene Wenger has strenuously denied that one. So must be happening! Ha!
 @simply_arsenal I think there's a chance, yes. Not done though. I try - sorry 
 Looking at Manchester City, I think Arsenal could sign Superman, Spiderman, Captain America, Batman and Robin and still finish second. 
 Manchester United's Treble winners, Liverpool and Everton in the 80s, Arsenal Invincibles. Manchester City can be in that great company. 
Here's my #afc web column and look at Arsenal transfer bingo. And the dynamics of a transfer window from a media view ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsene-wenger-transfer-bingo-arsenals-3093499#.UupPVvl_uYI …

Reports out of Russia saying Arsenal having talks with Spartak Moscow over Kim Kallstrom. Follow our live blog here: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/transfer-news-live-latest-big-3095786 …
 Kim Kallstrom has arrived at Arsenal training ground to complete talks, medical and loan deal. Could poss play Sunday. More on live blog 
I actually think Kallstrom could be good stop gap loan signing. I don't think there will be any more deals from Arsenal
 Salomon Kalou is killing Sebastian Frey as the player most   linked   to Arsenal down the years. Sadly, don't think it's a go-er. 
Välkommen till Arsenal och lycka #kallstrom
I wrote about Arsenal being willing to pay the £37m to sign Julian Draxler in this morning's paper. Arsene Wenger didn't value him that high
And the same people who want Arsenal to sign a second rate or washed up striker are the same who complain that #afc signed Ju Young Park.
 I do feel, however, Arsenal are a striker light of a title winning squad. But now isn't the time to buy strikers. Last summer was. 
But Arsenal enjoying their best season for years so can't quite see why today is being painted as such a crisis by some.
 @LBrooker11 There was no interest in Kalou. Kalou was interested in Arsenal, not the other way round. 
Arsenal didn't make loan bids for Kalou or Vucinic. I think they made bids to join Arsenal. Neither were considered.
Arsenal loan Park to Watford - then re-sign him to solve their striker crisis
Arsene Wenger says Man City getting lucky with all the breaks - and claims it's going to change in Arsenal's favour ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-city-been-lucky-cannot-3099114#.UuydJn8gGSM …
 Two of the Arsenal fans groups, AST and BSM, say the price increase should be refunded. Hard to argue against that if no money spent. 
Fulham v Southampton today. Arsenal v Crystal Palace tomorrow. Great weekend for me.
@Nabdi28 @Tomthegunner @arsenal_michael I agree with AW stance and if u keyboard warriors naively believe summat else feel free to unfollow.

Ox in the middle today? Maybe Wenger will think of that alongside Arteta. A few selection dilemmas for Arsenal...
All over. Ox 2-0. Arsenal 2-0. Arsenal top.
 Terrific win for Arsenal. If you're gonna win titles, gotta expect teams to come and park the bus. The challenge is to beat them 
 Arsenal so tough to beat. Szczesny excellent behind terrific back four. Ox my MotM. Cazorla excellent, too.

 Watching Arsenal again, they look just as bad - if not worse. Szczesny, Wilshere and Ox tried hard. Proof Gibbs is first choice left back. 
@danielstorey85 @RorySmithTimes I appreciate that. It's why Arsenal games were postponed in the past. But dig deep into those TV funds...
@RorySmithTimes When Arsenal was off in the past it was over staff/stewards. Maybe clubs might think about dipping into their TV cash...!

@TheArsenal_ You seem to set out to have a row every time. He's a great player and will be great for Arsenal. Even without training (joke).
 Brilliant column by @OllieHolt22 on Arsenal. The fans, Wenger and volcanoes ready to blow. Great read: ://bit.ly/1nsFr8l  
Find it amazing how many Arsenal fans are in denial. Win and Wenger's a God. Lose and he must go. Few other supporters turn so quickly.
 Clearly, that is far from being every Arsenal fan. But it's a loud section of fans at games. And the Twittersphere can be even more ruthless 
I hope that the large section of Arsenal fans who appreciate what Wenger does for the club will make their voice heard the loudest.
At Arsenal vs Man United. Has Ozil spent the day in the gym drinking protein shakes? Big performance needed. Huge game for both sides.
 Fancy Man United to get a result. Arsenal nervy and weary. Moyes needs it, RVP fired up and looking to seize on #afc tension. 
Just made my first entry for our live @mirrorfootball blog. Follow Arsenal v Man U and all the games here: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-vs-manchester-united-live-3138382 …
 Arsenal billing an interview with club legend at h/t. Tony Adams. David O'Leary also here, but - sadly - not sure he's loved so much anymore 
#afc Wenger admitted Arsenal looked nervous - and they did. Need a result to get the belief back. Big positive was Ozil's good performance.
Easy to forget Arsenal one point off the top. But titles are all about momentum. In my opinion that was lost through a lack of Jan signings.
#afc Wenger admits Arsenal's title bid is suffering a nervous breakdown. They look shattered. Needed help in January ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-0-0-manchester-united-were-3140044 …
Moment of the match was Szczesny's save from RvP. Outstanding. Arsenal c/halves good. Arteta looks shattered. Can't decide on Giroud...
 But one thing's for sure, it was a poor game. And the fact Arsenal fans so disappointed to draw tells you all you need to know about Man Utd

 @GoonerGirl1969 I'd love you as a friend. When Arteta signed, I wrote he'd saved Arsenal's window. What puzzles me is why they follow me!

 Final one on Arsenal. Wenger was talking generally, not specifically Mourinho. Mourinho's response was sensational but lacked any class. 
@lionsex they are arsenal fans so my description is accurate and nowhere do I say they speak for all.
Off to Arsenal v Liverpool later. Fancy Liverpool because of their momentum. Think #afc will make more changes than #lfc. We'll see...
I think Man City showed winning a cup tie can be momentum for Europe. Losing it much worse. Arsenal fans want a trophy - or so they tell me.
Arsenal resting players for a game they can win for a game they can't. Wenger playing with fire in my view. Huge gamble #afc
Liverpool have gone very strong. I think Wenger underestimating the strength of feeling among Arsenal fans and how much they want a trophy.
The Arsenal team looks a huge gamble to me. Sanogo up top. And the one that gets me is Ozil - doesn't he need a rest more than anyone?
Arsenal survived a whole minute without conceding this week. Impressive.
1-0 Arsenal Oxlade-Chamberlain. Wenger-o-metre back into genius mode.
 Arsenal fans get their wish - Podolski plays, scores, makes it 2-0. 
All over. Arsenal win 2-1.

Can remember last year's Arsenal v Bayern at Emirates feeling like men against boys. Still think there's a gap - but it's smaller.
En route to the Emirates. Fancy Arsenal to get a result. Over two legs think Bayern will go through. But could be a huge night tonight.
Fabulous effort by @arsenal with the cards before the game. The Emirates decked out in red and white.
 At 11 vs 11 it was a good contest. Arsenal bang in it. As soon as it went to 10 vs 11, just forget it. Arsenal did well to only lose 2-0.

Interesting that Pep Guardiola highlighted Kieran Gibbs as being one of Arsenal's top players. Hopefully England hierarchy will listen...
Off to Allianz Arena. Arsenal's performance last year was catalyst for their impressive run-in. They need another morale boosting display.

 @GeoffArsenal Ha ha, yes a bit lively. Heaven forbid someone for having an opinion. Didn't think he played well. Thought Arsenal did. You? 
 Thought Arsenal can take a lot from the game. Morale boosting. Some really good performances, a real lift for the run in like last year. 
@SheWore Arsenal fans been battering him for not picking Gibbs but today he's ok cos he's been sympathetic to Ozil. Wind blows etc
 Bad night for Ozil, good night for Ox, some positives for Arsenal moving forward after Bayern. #afc heads held high://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/mesut-ozil-looks-lost-arsenal-3232106 …

My @MirrorFootball video verdict on Arsenal after Champions League exit to Bayern Munich ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-vs-bayern-munich-martin-3232815 …
Where are the amazing Arsenal and Tottenham combined teams which can never happen? What is the ratio of players now? Oh how I miss them.
 @PaulPonting Thanks, Paul. At least you realised what Ozil and Out was about. I think City fans were more upset than Arsenal! I like yours 
 @sut87 OK. First edition, Arsenal claimed he was injured. It went in as claim he was injured. Afterwards, Wenger said he was injured. 
@JsMills In as much as if Spurs win then they can make top 4. If Arsenal win then you'd think that's a top 4 finish if not better guaranteed
At Arsenal training ground for press conf. Surely #thfc have to win to stay in hunt for top 4 finish. #afc win probably nails down top 4
#afc Wenger likes Tim Sherwood - not least because he's an Arsenal fan. There's genuine respect there for #thfc boss://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-vs-tottenham-arsene-wenger-3243686 …
 @Chrisdavies1966 Sorry pal, get lots of replies especially when I have the audacity to criticise Jose or - heaven forbid - an Arsenal player 
 This time last year - albeit two weeks earlier - Tottenham beat Arsenal 2-1, went 7 clear and AVB made his   negative spiral   remark. 
 Arsenal haven't won at WHL in PL since 2007. If they win today, they're right back in the title race with key rivals to play. Big chance. 
If Arsenal can come through the next two games intact then just look at the run-in. That's a huge ask. But #afc bang in the race after this
 And having watched Liverpool earlier, they can win the title. No question. Especially with Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City playing each other. 
Love the way the Arsenal players celebrated. They know how much the N London derby means. The Spurs players raised their game too.
Twitter is such a weird place. I have a look at my replies after finishing writing and get so much abuse from Arsenal fans. You've just won!
 @PaulPonting Arsenal defended so well, heroic stuff 
@mcfcforum I'm anti Arsenal apparently because I had the audacity to be critical.
 @jodal1979 Being an Arsenal analyst, you might have noticed they did make two signings... 
@Mark__Bright I'm now deemed to be public enemy no1 and anti Arsenal as I had the audacity to be a bit critical last week.
Unmissable #afc interview on Talksport as @talkSPORTDrive talks with Arsenal legend Pat Rice at 5pm. Guaranteed great listen. Show k/o 4pm.

*joke 
@mrdanwalker Typical anti-Arsenal media agenda. Reconvene here next week for next week's media agenda.
 @mrdanwalker Oh no, haven't you heard? Twitter says I'm anti-Arsenal. The worst of the lot. Well, bar one... 
Do Arsenal get to replay the game? One of the most bizarre incidents I've ever seen. #afc gone missing in another big game. #cfc awesome.
Referees' union gone missing on this one. Who else can they find to blame? Shouldn't detract from gutless Arsenal display.

Off to Emirates shortly. Arsenal v Swansea. Huge test of Arsenal's mental strength. Swansea consistently strong and tough opponents.
 #afc Only 2 changes for Arsenal, Vermaelen and Flamini both in. Pod and Kos out. Though Szczesny expected to play right wing, Ox in goal. 
 Arsenal's intricate play continually breaking down. They look a team short on confidence, zip and ideas. Swansea comfortable and ahead 1-0. 
 Arsenal booed off at half time. Swansea lead, brilliant Bony header. 
Heartbreak for Arsenal and Flamini. Could have been even worse had ref Probert not blown for full time. 2-2
 No doubt about it, Arsenal got the jitters. Swansea will feel aggrieved. 
How Arsenal needed a win. And probably deserved it overall. But no luck at the moment
 Flicking through my replies, never known such a split on whether Arsenal deserved something from the game or not 
Even Wenger admitted it's now a battle to hang onto fourth. Arsenal need a major confidence boost.
Where do Arsenal go from here? They look flat. Wenger down. Ramsey had setback. No idea when Wilshere back.
 #afc Wenger admits Arsenal looking over their shoulders. Ramsey injury setback, says Wilshere nowhere near returning ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-looking-over-shoulders-champions-3286189 … 
 So, by the same logic, shouldn't Wenger command the same respect from Arsenal fans? He's done so much for the club. 
 Shame on the hate-filled Arsenal fans spouting abuse at Wenger. Whether you want him to go or stay, the least Wenger deserves is respect. 
Wenger deserves and needs the respect and support of Arsenal fans. I still think he's the man - but clearly he needs to spend and rebuild.
@piersmorgan @OllieHolt22 And if Arsenal win the FA Cup and finish fourth do you think that is progress?

Heading to #afc v #mcfc. Huge game for both. City brimming with confidence. Arsenal nervous. Hard not to see an away win today.
Man City on the break are fantastic and dangerous. Arsenal wide open down their left. But Arsenal responded well since going behind to Silva

Great response from Arsenal. Easy to let heads drop. But they showed great spirit and determination. Lifts the mood.
Saw Tony Adams after the game. Arsenal showed the sort of spirit in the second half that he'd have been proud of.
If Arsenal had beaten Swansea and Man City... Fine margins. But thought performance galvanised squad again. Strong response.

 Fair to say the Arsenal medical team stressed no players at the club have those issues. Wenger was in a very good, upbeat mood yesterday. 
@_PaulHayward Looks fair enough. Liverpool's a bit generous. Arsenal's not changed all season...
Also think Everton will win at Goodison. Think they'll start fast and go for Arsenal. Huge test of resolve in the battle for fourth.
I thought Arsenal would line up like that. Maybe the theory is Ox's pace best used from the bench. Shame he's not starting IMO
Arsenal well beaten by the better team. For years #afc fans said they'd swap top 4 for a trophy. Wonder if they would now?

@ArsenalAndrew @DailyCannon Paranoid comparisons. Hope you compare column inches devoted to United's disastrous season to Arsenal's season.
 At Arsenal training ground for FA Cup semi final press conference. If Arsenal can't lift the gloom asap, their season will fall apart. 
Worth remembering Arsenal tried to sign Demba Ba on loan and Wenger applauded Everton's use of the loan rules.
@washyourmouth1  They claimed they would have... for a big fee. Arsenal felt otherwise.
@albrookshawAFC He does a newspaper press conference and it was in there so not on Arsenal player.
Feels like a pivotal day for Arsenal and Wenger's future. Wenger hasn't done very well against young progressive managers this season...
I'm off to Wembley later. Don't know whether Wigan can feast on the pressure and uncertainty surrounding Arsenal. Interesting day ahead...
The most damning thing is that Arsenal have no impact player on the bench.
Arsenal have been awful.
Arsenal getting that Birmingham feeling...
Arsenal will be desperate for it not to go to penalties. Yaya Sanogo might take one.
Oxlade-Chamberlain has run himself into the ground. Ox been Arsenal's best player for me. Gibbs has been excellent since coming on.
 @HarlowGooner @sharpy58  I think Arsenal deserved to win. Forgive me for being nice, but Wigan gave everything and to lose on pens is hard 
The FA Cup still matters and that viewing figure proves it. As does Wigan's dogged determination. And Arsenal's celebrations at the end.
Roy Keane is great pundit. But why on earth would he mock Arsenal celebrations when ITV had told us for 2hours how important the FA Cup was?

Arsenal confirm Alexis Sanchez has agreed to join. What a fantastic transfer coup. #afc
 It's a game changer for Arsenal. A world class signing. Pace, power, goals. A target for Ozil. A versatile forward. Fabulous deal. #afc 
Debuchy next. Then if Arsenal can add the sort of top class midfielder they want then they will be major contenders next season. #afc
Why the signing of Sanchez takes Arsenal to a whole new level - on and off the pitch #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/alexis-sanchez-signing-means-arsenal-3843447 …
 Arsenal interest in Khedira is clear. But financials involved would be HUGE. For that reason, I'm a bit sceptical as to whether it'll happen

 As mentioned last week, think the Arsenal and Manquillo trail has gone cold. A realisation he won't play much. Liverpool in box seat.

Arsenal signed one of best No10s in world. But don't play him there. Two sides to every story so I have sympathy with Ozil. But must do more
@jeromepugmire Agreed - though I think he played really well in the WC final. But he needs some form for Arsenal.
@simply_arsenal  We do separate press conferences with him which aren't filmed but are in our newspapers and it's brought up most times.
Just been hit with a text. A mate says Arsenal fans not very supportive when players are struggling. Is that fair? I know a lot who are.

It's absolute nonsense to go on about Fabregas. He didn't want to come to Arsenal. He wanted to go to Chelsea. And he can't play c/half.
So much anger on here. Even got abuse for saying that Arsenal claimed it should have been a foul on the Hull equaliser. Bizarre.

Liverpool and Tottenham faced v good teams. Still surprised Spurs went out. Arsenal and Man City horribly exposed tactically. Depressing.
 Confused? You should be. I am. Maybe Arsenal should've appealed the Giroud red card v QPR. Meanwhile, Matic misses Wembley.

Arsenal need some raw pace here to change it. Austin pile drivers been the best efforts. 0-0.
Arsenal should have had a penalty and Henry lucky not to be sent off for pulling back Ozil.

Big day for Arsenal and Wenger. He needs to end that hoodoo...
Got my predicted Arsenal team right. That'll probably be the one and only time this season...
 Arsenal: Cech; Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Cazorla; Ramsey, Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Walcott. 
Oxlade-Chamberlain has been on fire in pre-season. Walcott gets the nod over Giroud. Arsenal look strong... #afc

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gives Arsenal the lead. 1-0. That's Arsenal's first goal in 506 minutes against Chelsea.
Is the loud cheering of Petr Cech's every touch by Arsenal fans going to last all season? Talk about being Mr Popular...
Arsenal win 1-0. Surely it's time for a selfie just to please Roy Keane....
Does it give Arsenal a psychological edge? Maybe. Certainly gets a monkey off Wenger's back. Cech is now a God among Arsenal fans. #afc

Brilliant strike by Ward. You can't reproach Cech there. Unlike general defending... Arsenal punished for not turning superiority into goals

 Here's a podcast with me, @adrianjclarke, @amylawrence71 and @philippeauclair talking Arsenal and Arsene Wenger ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-secrets-revealed-podcast-john-6463862 … 
Off to Chelsea v Arsenal. #afc Euro jet lag and wretched record v Mourinho spells danger for Wenger. #cfc can kickstart season with a win...
The hardpan lunatic that is Santi Cazorla is sent off as Arsenal are reduced to nine men. Diego Costa remains on the pitch.
 Arsenal fans now chanting   off, off, off   when their own players make a foul. I think it's called irony. 
Arsenal down to nine men. Jose Mourinho about to bring on Mikel to shore the game up. I think he wants to win. A lot.
 West Ham have now beaten Man City, Arsenal and Liverpool away from home. Incredible. 
 @AFCvTheEnemy Ha ha, he doesn't hate Arsenal. But I would agree with his view. 
#afc Wenger says time for refs to wise up in Costa. And better news for Arsenal on Coquelin ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/refs-should-wise-diego-costas-6481808 …
 Jose Mourinho says Arsenal have title winning squad, he'd like to sign them all - as long as they were free #afc #cfc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelseas-jose-mourinho-aims-new-6480914 …

 Left out for Champions League and Arsenal games, Jose Mourinho says #cfc captain John Terry will play against Walsall://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelseas-john-terry-play-vs-6482891 … 
Arsenal to ask FA to reduce the length of Gabriel's ban - even if they can't appeal the red. Costa decision later. ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-ready-ask-fa-reduce-6486950 …
 We can officially file under Battle of the Bridge. Costa, Gabriel, Arsenal and Chelsea have been charged by the FA. Cazorla also warned. 
Olivier Giroud set for Arsenal recall as Arsene Wenger goes with experience against Tottenham #afc #thfc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/olivier-giroud-set-arsenal-recall-6489490 …
Gabriel failing to leave pitch was always going to get an extra charge. Arsenal appealed for wrongful dismissal and excessive punishment.
And Fergie is not alone. Wenger also had something similar at Arsenal #afc #mufc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fergies-book-shows-managers-care-6492054 …
Arsenal appeal on Gabriel red card upheld
Want to know why Gabriel got off? Here's why. Arsenal proved to the FA his kick made NO CONTACT with Costa #cfc #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-beat-gabriels-red-card-6494420 …
 Arsenal have actually had more   not seen   cases referred by the FA than Chelsea since current retrospective system introduced in 04/05. 
 Newcastle have had the most with 7. Arsenal, Man City all have 6. Man United and Chelsea 5. 
Chelsea left fuming as Diego Costa gets three game ban - but Arsenal's Gabriel is cleared by FA #afc #cfc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelsea-fume-after-diego-costa-6495135 …

I do think it's unfair to blindly say Arsenal do no work on the oppo or game prep. That's not right. But doesn't everyone have bad days?
 Rather like against Monaco, it was Arsenal's midfield which went gung-ho against Olympiacos, lost discipline and offered no protection.

 Gazidis said:   Petr Cech told me that Arsenal is the only club he could have joined and had a tug of war with a member of ground staff.   
   I've never felt more confident that I do today that we can create more special moments... and make us all proud to be Arsenal.   Gazidis. 
Ivan Gazidis says Arsenal have frozen prices in 7 of last 10 years and inflation rises in the other three.
 Gazidis said:   Almost no-one gives up an Arsenal season ticket. We had 97 pc renewal rate. But in the face of demand, board holds prices.   
Shareholder now saying how lucky Arsenal are to have Wenger and the Kroenke family at the club.
 My Arsenal AGM shareholder ratings: Sir Chips 4, Wenger 9, Gazidis 8, Miles 6 (solid, didn't put foot wrong). 
   But look at the number of games Arsenal played in the Champs League before me and after I arrived and come back to me,   said Wenger.

 On Arsenal injuries, what serious medical professional would say so much without inside knowledge? Very bizarre. No wonder Wenger bit back.

 If Arsenal go out, they'll go out trying. Theo Walcott (just back from injury) is a big gamble. But it's an attacking one. #gungho 
 Great support from 1,200 travelling Arsenal fans. Nice touch from Olympiacos fans who gave Joel Campbell - spent year here - good reception. 
Never saw that coming. One of Arsenal's great European nights.

If Arsenal were as tenacious in their defending as they were in their complaining...
Wojciech Szczesny had a cheeky smoke in the showers last time Southampton beat Arsenal 2-0 here. Who's got the Marlboro Lights today...?
Arsenal have been awful today. I can't think of many worse performances this season. They haven't shown up. Where's Monday night's team?
Fourth official holds up four minutes added time. Half expect Wenger to plead with him to reduce it and limit the punishment. Arsenal awful.
 All over. Southampton 4 Arsenal 0. Saints superb, worked so hard. They've dusted down Kool and the Gang's Celebration for the final whistle. 
 Arsenal were awful, absolutely awful. You have to question whether they've got the bottle for a title race after this. Didn't look it.

Have Arsenal got the mental strength or squad depth to win the Premier League title? #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/southampton-4-0-arsenal-5-7055326 …
Difficult to know where the Arsenal team which beat Man City went. But far better they win that game because it takes points off title rival
Chelsea and Tottenham battle for Jackson Martinez. Did Arsenal have a lucky escape? Wenger likes him... s://twitter.com/mirrorfootball/status/680879282793627649 …
 Despite Wenger's complaints, Southampton were far better in every department than Arsenal. They thoroughly deserved their win. Excellent. 
@iandstone Wanyama absolutely bossed midfield and Arsenal didn't have the legs to compete. Wenger almost philosophical afterwards. Bit odd

 If Arsenal don't win tonight, it'll get really toxic. Even if they do, some fans can't be won back. This is Wenger's biggest ever challenge.

Vardy has been put into a few clubs. Arsenal didn't bite last month - but have now. Can Leicester keep him? ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-open-jamie-vardy-transfer-8110911 …
 If Arsenal complete the Vardy deal, that'll be £50m spent. Lessons being learnt. They're going for it. Crack open the war chests. 
And I must say I'm staggered. I know Arsenal were sounded out last month (a few clubs were) and didn't bite then. They've gone for it now.
putting it mildly... Arsenal were offered it a while back and said no as well.

Stuart Pearce was fascinating on @SportsBreakfast on dilemma facing Jamie Vardy. To stay with Leicester or join Arsenal. Amazing twist...
 Continue to be a hero at Leicester, better contract in offing. Or move to Arsenal, at 29, one last shot at big move. Decision expected asap. 
 I still think he'll join Arsenal, but he obviously thinks there is a decision to make.

Arsenal have thrown the kitchen sink at Jamie Vardy. Not a penny scrimped. I'm sure Arsenal's offer is better than Leicester's counter offer
 I don't think Arsenal have been   played   because they went for it unprompted, having knocked back a previous approach. We'll see... 
 But when I wrote on Sunday that Leicester had asked for more time to make better offer, feared Arsenal might miss out. Summat special at KP.

Hear Arsenal are in the mix for Lucas Perez. Everton had it all agreed. That's now on hold after Arsenal came in. More on @MirrorFootball
Arsenal very hopeful that £17m deal for Deportivo La Coruna striker Lucas Perez will be done. Maybe Champions League football swung it.
Arsenal very hopeful of getting this done. The game at Leicester suggested a striker needed more than a defender... s://twitter.com/mirrorfootball/status/768743253676097536 …
Many clubs try to structure deals in instalments. It really is pretty standard. Would still expect Lucas Perez to join Arsenal.
Great draw for Leicester. Spurs can get through and Arsenal really should.
 On Talksport @talkSPORTKO with Ray Wilkins, @marksaggers and @CharlieWyett with Arsenal chat next... 
Arsenal close in on Perez - even though he was deemed not good enough a month ago. Mustafi also back on #afc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-target-lucas-perez-8706193 …

Good on Arsenal to get deals done. But will never understand a logic - and it must be because it happens every year - in doing deals late.
 Good planning is getting deals done before poss blowing 9 points. In fairness, not just Arsenal. But clubs who buy early tend to do better

 Arsenal passed on Perez on more than 1 occasion. But things change, just as they did with Mustafi. If both get completed, it's a good window 
 Do you actually think I do Arsenal's scouting?!?! I've never passed comment on his ability, just reported what I've heard. 
 On the @theofficialfwa podcast discussing this weekend's fixtures, Arsenal's new signings and West Ham's woes s://twitter.com/theofficialfwa/status/769196892836290560 …

Arsenal to let Wilshere go out on loan to help him get game time. He needs games and some luck for a change #afc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsene-wenger-ready-jack-wilshere-8731189 …

 Wilshere at a crossroads in his career so Arsenal loaning him makes sense. Offers from PL, Italy and Spain. My view  ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jack-wilshere-crossroads-leaving-arsenal-8732189 … 
Arsenal confirm Mustafi
Crystal Palace hoping to complete loan deal for Jack Wilshere amid 22 offers for Arsenal midfielder  ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenals-jack-wilshere-poised-transfer-8737061 …
I think Mustafi has the makings of a top signing for Arsenal. Big statement and big day for the club. Very busy and good day's work.
 In fairness, not necessarily his decision as Arsenal might've (it's been suggested to me) been reluctant to deal with Italian clubs 
Arsenal show ambition - now want Ozil to sign #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-hope-shkodran-mustafi-signing-8749370 …
Easy option was for Wilshere to stay put. It's a great life at Arsenal. To go on loan is the brave choice. Deserves credit not criticism.
My impression is Arsenal happy to deal with Bournemouth. So was Italian route really an option? Not sure it was... So don't knock him.

Quick refile. Arsenal win 2-1. I think Arsenal should have put the ball out and referee should have stopped it because of head injury.

Arsenal have only just arrived!
That's the South Circular for you... You'd think Arsenal would know their way round South London (insert your own gag here etc)
Arsenal have finally come out to warm up. This isn't great preparation...
1-0 Palace. Townsend. Arsenal been very sloppy.
Arsenal have been a shambles in defence. The best thing you can say about them is the travelling support - stayed right behind the team.
 Proof here tonight at Selhurst Park Arsenal can't give Arsene Wenger another contract. He's been amazing. But it's gone now, time for change 
 Palace, meanwhile, have given Arsenal a lesson in fight and spirit.

You work in business. Same common sense rules also apply to football - open dialogue ongoing.
 Thanks so much, Neil 
 By the way, I think it's a big mistake. Anyway... Maybe if it really does get worse then even he will realise it's time (probably not)

 Man City applying almost constant pressure. Arsenal simply unable to keep the ball in midfield or, more importantly, no holdup from forwards 
 Arsenal very fortunate to be on level terms, Man City dominating and had a goal wrongly disallowed. 0-0 h/t 
 Oxlade-Chamberlain subbed, Arsenal's best player by some distance in my view. 
Arsenal have done it! Win 2-1 extra time. Wenger's love affair with the FA Cup continues. A few knockers need to hang their heads in shame.
 Man City terrific first half, you couldn't have believed they'd have lost at h/time. Arsenal's resilience won it but City will rue chances 
The Arsenal board heads straight for the dressing room to congratulate the players.

 Rare that I disagree Dicko, but he's arguably been Arsenal's best player for the past two months. Not saying much, I grant you... 
 However, his form is way below his world class standards. But if you put Eriksen in that Arsenal team at the moment and he'd struggle.

 But I totally agree, the Champs Lge has been Arsenal's and Wenger's biggest disappointment

I suppose fans staying away is not a new phenomenon. Happened a lot at Arsenal in the 80s. But I will never quite understand it.
 That's why I thought the Arsenal fans in the stadium were different class tonight. Stuck with the team, chanted throughout. Proper. 
 Well, that's a first... absolutely different class. Arsenal fans get ridiculed by bloggers, media etc who don't go and it drives me nuts 
I think Arsenal have more than most. Just my opinion. That's why it feeds so much debate and media coverage.

 I half suspect that it could be a pre cursor to him moving towards Everton. Shows he gets nowhere with Arsenal, then leaves. Just a theory.. 
I'm convinced Arsene Wenger is staying on as Arsenal boss. Here's the details and why: ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenals-arsene-wenger-agrees-behind-10456722 …
Arsene Wenger set to stay on as Arsenal boss amid behind-the-scenes reshuffle ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenals-arsene-wenger-agrees-behind-10456722 …
The only way that changes is if Wenger has a change of heart but that would mean leaving Arsenal in the lurch and I don't see that happening
 So, Arsene Wenger stays as Arsenal boss. 
 Stan Kroenke is not selling Arsenal and is in for the long term to win trophies, sources tell Mirror Sport ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/stan-kroenke-not-sell-arsenal-10459521 … 
Arsenal simply not for sale. End of. ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/stan-kroenke-not-sell-arsenal-10459521 …
 Arsenal keeper Petr Cech is 35 today. The Premier League clean sheet record holder. And the best keeper in the PL era, in my opinion. 
And I'm off to Arsenal v Everton. It won't be Wenger's last game at Emirates. He stays. But it will be end of an era for his top 4 record.

 Mustafi is ill, Gibbs has thigh. Thought Arsenal might go to back to a back four today. But Welbeck starts up top, Koscielny fit.

1-0 Arsenal
Cup final gone for the Arsenal captain. It was a shocking challenge.
 Arsenal fans now booing Valencia. Yes, it was totally his fault that Koscielny launched a ridiculous challenge. 
Liverpool winning. Arsenal were in the top four for 39 minutes.
Arsenal have played with ten men for more than an hour and yet if it hadn't been for Robles and poor finishing it would have been six.
 Arsenal fans singing the Ozil song, he's been excellent. But Bellerin my man of the match. Had a brilliant game.

Astonishing. Arsenal win 2-1. Arsene Wenger is the most successful manager in FA Cup history.
 I made Mertesacker my MotM. But you could've chosen quite a few today. Incredible performance by Arsenal, really dug deep.

Man Utd (AC Milan) and Chelsea (Inter Milan) could be in trouble. Arsenal (Porto) will be delighted. Liverpool set for Europa League draw
Five defeats before Christmas for United. Villa jump above Arsenal into third. This is shaping up to be a cracking Premier League season...
Plenty of empty seats among home fans at Upton Park. Arsenal supporters busy serenading Alex Song in last match before Africa Cup of Nations
Arsenal very much on top of West Ham at Upton Park. Under-strength Hammers struggling to get into game. Striker Nouble starved of service
West Ham growing in confidence with Arsenal struggling to keep hold of ball. Hosts almost get in on goal when Wilshere twice loses possesion
Mikael Silvestre gets an absolute earful from Arsenal fans after woeful attempt at playing Diamanti offside leads to West Ham going 1-0 up
Error-ridden Arsenal being exposed by hungry & sharp West Ham. Merida & Silvestre being slated by away supporters. Arsenal struggling badly

 #Arsenal squad stepping off the bus at Villa Park has remarkably diff look to that at Stoke on Sun. Likes of GC, WG, TV, BS, SN, NB all back 
 Aston Villa - Luke Young in for Warnock. Arsenal - strongest available side with Bendtner, Nasri, Walcott and Campbell on bench 
 Villa make a strong counter-attacking start against Arsenal. Agbonlahor denied by Almunia's fingertips, Young curls a free-kick just wide 
Fabregas beats 2 men and drills a shot across goal but it comes back off the post. Rare Arsenal attack. Villa by far the better side
Could Arsenal be about to lose another player to injury. Eduardo replaced by Bendtner. Rosicky smashes a shot against the bar. Open half

 #Arsenal news: Eboue in for Sagna, Bendtner replaces Walcott for first start since Oct. #Liverpool news: Skrtel in for Krygiakos. #football 
 Fairly dour first half at Emirates. #Arsenal look nervous, #Liverpool solid and confident. Got to hope this explodes into life in 2nd period 
Arsenal-Liverpool has burst into life in the second half. Diaby heads #Arsenal into a 1-0 lead. #Liverpool pressing for an equaliser
#Arsenal 1-0 #Liverpool. What was your verdict? Here's the write-up: ://bit.ly/cjTtGN #football
Miss of the season contender from #Birmingham. #Arsenal v lucky to escape #football
Nasri. Birmingham 0-1 Arsenal
Phillips 250th league goal. Birmingham 1-1 Arsenal
#Fabregas misses training & faces late fitness test ahead of #Barcelona. Will surely play. Gallas back in squad after 7wks out #Arsenal
Barca completely dominating early stages. Messi on fire. Arsenal look nervous wreck. Could be a painful night fot Gunners. Ibra woeful miss
Ibrahimovic puts Alves cross over from an unmarked position 6 yards out. #Barca should be 1-0 up. Barca's high pressing troubling #Arsenal
 Loose Diaby pass allows Alves to set Ibra free but drills into side netting. Arsenal fans getting v tetchy, getting on Diaby's back already 
 It's fair to say Barca should be winning 3-0 or 4-0 after 15 mins. Barca a diff class, Arsenal awful. Crowd rightly singing Almunia's name 
Arsenal eventually settle into some sort of tempo and Nasri fires inches wide. Eboue coming on for someone... maybe Arshavin who's hobbling
 Arsenal's injuries probs worsen. Denilson on for Gallas (1st game in 7 weeks with 2 days traininf, why start him?!?) Arsenal hanging on 
 One mistake is understandable bt never make the same mistake twice. Arsenal let Ibra in again down right channel. 2-0 Barca, richly deserved 
 How Arsenal weren't well beaten we'll never know. Barca switched off, Arsenal showed amazing spirit to draw 2-2. Cesc & Puyol out of 2nd leg 
@KernowChris It's looking more likely than not. United obviously stand a better chance than Arsenal but both games are very tricky to call
Off to the Emirates for #Arsenal v #Wolves? Predictions welcome... #football
Arsenal should be 2-0 up. At least. Rosicky crosses for Eduardo 6 yrds out but he completely miscues. Sagna races through bt shot well saved
Arsenal fans getting increasingly frustrated at their team's inability to break down a stubborn Wolves defence. Visitors quite comfortable
 Wolves resisting wave after wave of Arsenal attacks, aided by Walcott's woeful crossing and a lack of plan B from the Gunners 
Arsenal physio calls Nicklas Bendtner back from his warm-up to get stripped off. The Dane's coming on by the looks of it. But for who?
 Arsenal's game-plan: break from midfield, knock it right to Walcott, lose posession, start again. Jones puts a free-kick straight at Almunia 
Desperate times for Arsenal at the Emirates. Wolves defending for their lives by hook or by crook. Arsenal's title bid over if they dont win

 #Wenger praises #Spurs defending and counter-attack.   They were sharper than us   - worrying given #Arsenal had 5 days more prep than Spurs

Wigan 3-2 Arsenal. N'Zogbia!!!! What a goal
#Wigan deserve win. Arrogant #Arsenal didn't shown up in 2nd half. What's that #Wenger always says about Arsenal mental strength? #football

Arsenal have triggered Jamie Vardy release clause & in talks with Leicester to sign the striker. Story broken by @StuartJamesGNM #AFC #LCFC
No decision yet from Jamie Vardy on joining Arsenal or accepting Leicetser's counter offer. He is still expected to decide today #AFC #LCFC
 Vardy camp has told Arsenal he wants to focus on #EURO2016 with #ENG - still no decision. #AFC not pulling out, offer remains on table #LCFC 
 Vardy set to reject Arsenal & stay at Leicester. No final decision yet but favouring #LCFC. #AFC won't improve offer, pursuing other options 
Arsenal CB Gabriel out 6/8wks - ankle sprain. Not quite as bad as he 1st feared but #AFC stepping up pursuit of Valencia's Shkodran Mustafi
Arsenal yet to agree fee for Mustafi. #AFC considering Omer Toprak & Simon Kjaer as alternatives but Mustafi remains priority & keen to join
 Price the issue. Arsenal want to hold back funds for possible striker signing. #AFC transfer budget factors in fee, salary, agent commission 
 Arsenal interested in signing Deportivo La Coruna CF Lucas Perez. Not done deal but #AFC in contention - 27yo, 17 gls in 37 apps last season 
 Estimate by @AST_arsenal was £96m for signings. After Xhaka/Holding/Asano/Kalechi & £40+m CB (Mustafi 1st choice), not much left for CF #AFC 
 @GeoffArsenal @AST_arsenal AFC have funds to spend huge if AW wants player & deal is possible, as he said. But outside that, this is budget 
 Arsenal have beaten Everton to signing of Deportivo La Coruna striker Lucas Perez. Deal agreed, #AFC meeting €20m release clause, 17.1m #EFC 
Arsenal close to agreeing deal to sign Valencia centre-back Shkodran Mustafi. #AFC will pay fee in excess of £35m for Germany international
 Arsenal agree £35m deal with Valencia for Mustafi. Will fly to London for medical, seal terms on 5yr contract. Perez medical also today #AFC 
 Apologies, Arsenal in talks with Werder Bremen over sale of winger Serge Gnabry. Not done yet but would be permanent deal #AFC #Werder

 Talking Arsenal & Wenger with @RobBonnet on @BBCr4today shortly: how new deal came about, what happens next etc #AFC://www.bbc.co.uk/today  
 Arsene Wenger today physically signed a new two-year contract (no break clause) to remain Arsenal manager until 2019, 23 years in total #AFC 
Neither Arsenal nor Wenger see this definitely being his final contract - may be but equally might not. Depends what happens next 2yrs #AFC
 BBC online entry miswritten by desk - I didn't confirm/deny story, merely said Arsenal are denying it, now corrected ://bbc.in/2rt37nq  
As reported by others Arsenal are in talks with Lyon to sign striker Alexandre Lacazette. 1st bid was rejected but negotiations ongoing #AFC
Again as others report Arsenal also had a bid rejected for Monaco winger Thomas Lemar. That seems less likely than a deal for Lacazette #AFC
No bids for Alexis Sanchez yet. May go if price right but may sign new deal. All hypothetical. Arsenal very reticent to sell to PL club #AFC
Arsenal transfer activity complicated by Sanchez/Ozil but not stopping it - targets being pursued irrespective #AFCs://twitter.com/bbcsport/status/880161001974493184 …
 Arsenal are close to agreeing a deal to sign Lyon striker Alexandre Lacazette. Negotiations continuing, expected to be club record fee #AFC 
Arsenal close to completing Lacazette deal. Final fee almost agreed & he'll then have medical & finalise terms to become #AFC record signing
 Worth pointing out that as things stand Arsenal still yet to receive any offers for Sanchez, Wenger planning with him in the team #AFC #MCFC 

 Just arrived in Oporto for Arsenal game. No Almunia, Gallas, Song, Arshavin, RVP etc. Difficult night ahead for Arsenal. 
At the dragao for porto v arsenal. Disappointingly sparse crowd.
2 mins - campbell already stripped for pace by Hulk. Porto should be 1-0 up. Long night in prospect for arsenal
HT 1-1. Arsenal have stabilised and playing some good football. Still very open but Sol is looking assured now
Fabregas getting kicked all over the place. Time running out for arsenal - tonight at least
 In taxi from dragao to hotel. Another very good game tonight. Arsenal played well at times, but individual errors blight them AGAIN 
 As for the 2nd goal, I'm all for quick free kicks. And I seem to recall arsenal scoring with a few down the years. Wenger furious though 
My match report on Porto 2 Arsenal 1 can be found here ://tinyurl.com/yavjewq
 Wenger says Hansson's   five mistakes   make him   incompetent  . What a good job players (esp Arsenal goalkeepers) are not assessed so harshly 
 And belatedly, this morning's Arsenal report here ://tinyurl.com/yfdnvld 
 @tomwfootball There'll be lots of competition for Rodwell if/when time comes to leave #Everton. #Chelsea, #Arsenal, #Man City like him too 
Just recorded The Game podcast with @marcotti @nickszczepanik and v perceptive ex arsenal star stewart robson. Will post link later
 Arsenal £35.2m profit (Adebayor/Toure) in 6 months to 30/11. Debt down from £332m to £203m, largely due to Highbury Square. Good work 
90 min - Arsenal penalty for handball against Pugh ...
 3-1 Vermaelen 90+4. Huge win for Arsenal, but at what cost? 
FT Stoke 1 Arsenal 3. Celebratory huddle from Arsenal players. Only 3 points behimd Chelsea. Game on
Anyway that's it for me. @spiki67 @OleGunner et al. Sorry no replies. I'll deal with all Arsenal/Shawcross issues on Timesonline this week
I can't answer all comments on Arsenal/Shawcross here but post them here bit.ly/cPtzrL and I'll respnd at length on Wednesday. Thanks
 I'm at Arsenal training ground, where England (inc Shawcross) are training this week. Waiting for Capello 
#football #Arsenal won't pursue compensation over Ramsey injury ://bit.ly/clJrRv
Did 300 Arsenal fans really send Shawcross sympathetic emails? Not much support for him among Arsenal fans emailing me ...
 Bad news for #Arsenal that Fabregas misses Porto game tmrw. Was going to be tough with him, never mind without him 
 #mufc should be fine up v milan, but #arsenal and #chelsea precarious. At least one English team will fall imho 
Still en route to Emirates for #arsenal v porto. Might not get time to savour the legendary hospitality in the Emirates press lounge ...
Arsenal 1-0 Bendtner 10 min. Slid in to convert loose ball after mix-up
#arsenal fully deserve that lead. Really strong start and some lovely play from Rosicky in particular
Arsenal 2-0 (Bendtner 25). Great work by Arshavin. Bendtner couldn't miss. Not tonight at any rate
Arsenal impressive and looking comfortable. Song is running the midfield
Neglected to update with Bendtner goal and 5-0 final score. #Arsenal football jaw-dropping at times
 You won't find me putting any money on #arsenal for PL or CL just yet, but their football at times tonight was  irresistible 
 Big question for #arsenal is how they cope against the best. United, Chelsea, Inter, even Barca won't let them play like that 
 Logic says others are more likely to win the CL, but if #arsenal fall short, far better to so playing like that

 @Sebinho9 No official confirmation, but word is that Chamakh to #Arsenal deal was agreed last month. I know other clubs think it's done 
Arsenal will play ... Barcelona. Repeat of 2006 final. One for the purist
 SF2: Inter or CSKA Moscow will play winners of Barcelona v Arsenal. Not Arsenal's year, I suspect. 
 @SurreyGooner I think beating Barcelona, Inter and United to win a first European Cup would indeed be Arsenal's greatest year. Tricky ... 
FT #arsenal 2-0. Deserved win. Song outstanding. #whufc offered alarmingly little against 10 men in 2nd half
 Still have certain doubts about #arsenal but they have real momentum. Big test next Sat at B'ham, where it all went wrong in 08 
@NickJoys All i'm saying is #arsenal don't have the experience/know-how of the other two. But i would love to see them pull it off.
 #cfc now 11/4 third-favourites for the title according to Ladbrokes press release. #mufc 10/11, #arsenal 2/1. #mcfc 100/1 
Something to clutch at for #arsenal and #chelsea fans: Rooney limping as he left Old Trafford with Mrs R. Six days to recover for Bolton tho
 @OleGunner Agree, but 95 points in 1st season in England, having dumped Crespo/Mutu/Veron, says it wasn't just down to £ or Arsenal decline 
 RT DTguardian #mufc unbeaten in 16 CL away games, includes barca, milan, inter, roma (x2), celtic, arsenal. (Excludes neutral venues...) 
 Incidentally, yet another defeat for English teams in Champions League. I keep saying it, but   Big Four   isn't what it was. Arsenal-Barca? 
 David Rocastle died nine years ago today (via @otfd). Won't mean much to #arsenal players tonight, but it will to the fans 
Tempted to say #mufc asked for this with only Owen/kids as cover for Rooney/Berba. But #arsenal #cfc #lfc also poorly stocked striker-wise
 @paul_tomkins points out Arsenal have RvP, Bendtner, Eduardo, Vela. But it's not Henry, Bergkamp, Kanu, Wiltord, Jeffers ... 
RT johncrossmirror So Cesc is in #Arsenal starting line-up as I said - but one more test to come. Wenger genuine about leaving it to the las
Remarkable start from #barca. Messi carrying the ball 40 yards - knife through butter. Busquets shot saved. #Arsenal need to tighten up
 #Arsenal were planning to fight fire with fire, but theyre going to need to find a way to extinguish #Barca attacks. Messi in so much space 
 Incredible stat on Uefa website: Barcelona 75% possession (only 75?) and 11 goal attempts 6 on target, 3 blocked) to Arsenal's none 
#Arsenal have lost Gallas and Arshavin and have barely had the ball. They should be getting trounced. But at 0-0 they're still  in this tie
 11 mins plus stoppages to go, #arsenal trailing 2-1 and Thierry Henry on for #barca. What odds an undeserved late equaliser? 
 Henry is last off pitch and leaves field to a great ovation, but what a game that was. 2-2 and, yes, #arsenal deserved it for spirit alone 
 The best stat you will read tonight (apart from the scoreline): Arsenal 265 passes completed, Barcelona 533 
 Wenger on being outplayed by Barca:   It's not easy, believe me, but you respect it more than when you've been kicked.   #arsenal 
 @medfly70 Undeserved on the balance of play. Deserved on basis that #arsenal showed character, pluck etc. Boot on the other foot tonight... 
@johncrossmirror saying Fabregas fears he has broken his leg. That would end his season.  World Cup? Arsenal confirm he'll have scan tmrw
 And if #arsenal fans are worried about Cesc, #mufc will be concerned to hear that Rooney injury is now sounding more like 4 weeks out 
 #Arsenal peoples pointing out that, if Cesc has suffered a fracture, it *could* only be slight like the one Vermaelen suffered in Jan. 
 All in all, a pretty stressful 24 hours for #arsenal and #mufc in the Champions League. Chelsea the only English beneficiaries? 
Match report: Arsenal 2 Barcelona 2 ://tinyurl.com/yzjhvls
Right. Early night for me. Early flight to Barcelona tmrw ahead of #arsenal game. I do love this job - despite everything ...
 @MarkyL #arsenal looked down and out after 70 mins of 1st leg, but Barca are depleted. It's a long shot but nothing like impossible 
 #Barca coach Guardiola in press conf:   The team that has the ball longest will have the possibility to win the game.   #arsenal 
 Guardiola defends Thierry Henry after Catalan press claim he lacked commitment v Arsenal.  He's always questioned for this.I don't know why   
 Great moment in Arsenal press conf. Walcott was asked how quick he could do 100 metres. Maybe 10.3 secs.  Wenger chips in:   I can do 17   
 Wenger on Catalan criticism of Henry:   I don't think that's fair. You can't reproach him after all the successful years he had with Arsenal   
Walcott's pace plants seed of uncertainty in Barcelona minds ://bit.ly/9oZpsf #arsenal
@SaroopChana Predictions: #Barca 2 #Arsenal 1 (agg 4-3). #Mufc 2 #Bayern 1 (agg 3-3 and who knows what happens next?)
 Just taken my seat at Camp Nou. What a place. Chants of   Emmanuel Eboué   ring out from #arsenal fans in the top tier ... 
 Was interesting to see Sol going around the #Arsenal players during warm-up, offering pep talks and sympathetic bear hugs 
 Arsenal will be pleased they've not been carved open yet, but their passing is v poor. Can't settle on the ball at all 
 Alarming statistic (albeit after just 16 mins): Barcelona pass completion 86% (104/121), Arsenal 49%. (19/39) 
18 min: Barcelona 0 Arsenal 1. Bendtner scores at second attempt after Diaby sends Walcott clear on the counter-attack!
 Another good stat after 28 mins: Fouls committed: Barcelona 3, Arsenal 12. Denilson got the ball there, but followed through dangerously 
 37 min: Barcelona 2 Arsenal 1. Arsenal caught out down their right flank. Ball dropped in area for Messi, who took chance with ease 
Sod it. Let's applaud him anyway. Messi 4 Arsenal 1. 87 min. Genius
 Wenger:   Over 2 games, for a team like Arsenal, we gave cheap goals away. Barcelona didn't have to work hard for the goals

RT @bensmith_times: Interesting comments from Peter Hill-Wood today. He says #Barca have promised #arsenal they won't bid for Fabregas
 @TheArsenal_  Not sure, but the vibes I've had from #Arsenal in recent months are that there won't be an issue over Cesc any time soon 
At White Hart Lane. Arsene Wenger has just strolled onto the pitch looking very relaxed with Sagna and Vermaelen #arsenal
 Ledley King, Danny Rose and Benoit Assou-Ekotto all come into the #Spurs team v Arsenal. Eboue apparently starts for #Arsenal 
They just read out teams at WHL. Only a few hundred in the ground but loud boos for Sol. Big cheers for Van Persie (sub) from Arsenal end
Saw Spurs stewards being briefed earlier not to let fans lean over the wall to tunnel and abuse Arsenal players (ie Campbell)
 #Arsenal fans singing   It's so quiet at the Lane.   It really isn't, you know 
 David Ginola walks onto pitch at HT to be greeted with chant of   You're just a s**t Robert Pires   (by Arsenal fans obviously) 
 RT @optajoe: Jermain Defoe made just one pass in 1st half of Spurs-Arsenal. (But his 2nd pass, to set up Crouch goal, is a classic. 2-0) 
Very lively night at the Lane. Astonished by Spurs' energy - Arsenal seemed surprised too. This fight for 4th is looking interesting
 Arsenal poor for 70 mins until RvP arrival.   Not mature enough   as Wenger put it. But goals conceded were down to sloppiness, not immaturity 
 Old hat, I know, but with a decent keeper and more strength in midfield, #Arsenal could have won league this year - despite injuries 
@ONeillio You don't think Arsenal were poor for 70 mins? You think they were dominant? Can't agree with that. Not even sure Wenger would...

 Done an interview in tmrw's Times with Arsenal/Bolton wonder kid Jack Wilshere, tipped by some as outside bet for England World Cup squad 
 Wilshere's a nice lad. I remember hearing once he was cocky, but he's not like that at all. Level-headed as well as talented. #arsenal #bwfc 
 Here's that Jack Wilshere interview. English football's next big thing? No pressure, Jack ... ://bit.ly/b0SZtm #arsenal #bwfc 
 @alex_stamp Re Wilshere, great talent. Only question, as with a young Joe Cole, is where he fits in. But he's well suited to Arsenal's 4-3-3 
 Generally sympathetic to Arsenal re reckless tackling, but malicious tackle from Van Persie could have injured Adebayor there 
 If it didn't look that way, it's a credit to Inter (and not just Mourinho). They're better than #Chelsea, #mufc, #arsenal 
Opinion split on my suggestion that Barca and Inter are 2 best teams in Europe. I'll put it like this: #Inter > #Chelsea > #mufc > #arsenal
FT Blackburn 2 Arsenal 1. Wenger looked like he hated every minute of that. No sign of a handshake with Allardyce at end
 For the record, because it's such an important issue, Wenger did shake Allardyce's hand at the final whistle #Arsenal #BRFC 
 WIth one game left, #Arsenal have same points (72) as they finished with last season. Progress, but not as much as hoped 
 As for the other Arsenal cast-off, this is best I've seen Toure play for at least two years. Nothing like the force he was though 
@DarrenEpstein1 Really interesting. Thanks. Gazidis is top man and top operator. Arsenal in very safe hands with him and Wenger
 Other Triesman highlights, Part 1: Arsenal   probably worst example   of failing to give English kids a chance. I disagree 
Surprised by apparent speed of developments with Barca Fabregas bid. Arsenal didn't expect them to bid for him this summer
Too many questions re Cesc! Trying to get answers before onward flight to Graz. Seems serious but Arsenal will fight hard
 If, as G Balague implies, Barca feel Arsenal   owe   them after using legal loophole to sign Cesc in 2003, they're misguided 
 @DanPlant Crossy (@johncrossmirror) has great contacts at Arsenal. If he's saying Cesc is off, I wouldn't laugh it off 
 Late-night text from #Arsenal contact suggests refusal to dance to Barca tune. #Cesc wants out, but they'll fight

RT @DarrenEpstein1: #Arsenal Red & White Holdings (Usmanov) bought 23 shares this morning.Now close to 27% of Arsenal ---> Thanks v much
Arsenal have rejected Barcelona's bid for Cesc Fabregas. Here's their statement  ://bit.ly/aT7TNT
 Arsenal statement on Cesc Fabregas:   We resolutely told them once again that we have no intention of selling our captain   
Sources in Barcelona confirm their bid for Cesc Fabregas was £29m (i.e. EUR 35m). Arsenal rejected it outright
 If you didn't gather as much from their statement, I can confirm Arsenal hierarchy are pretty unhappy with Barcelona ... 
 As @johncrossmirror said earlier, Joe Cole definitely hasn't signed for #Arsenal. Arsenal mystified by that rumour 
Barcelona set to ignore #Arsenal plea and make second bid for Cesc Fabregas ://bit.ly/c4i7J8
Can't find it online but I wrote a piece in today's Times saying that Arsenal have FINALLY made a move for Joe Cole
 Hello again. Did I miss anything? Arsenal bought a keeper yet? Fergie found any   value   in transfer market? 
 Fabregas confirms he's staying at Arsenal. Not the outcome he wanted, but he should be over it by now - til next summer, you suspect 
Well done Arsenal for digging their heels in re Cesc. Not easy under that pressure/provocation. Great for the league too
Leaving for Anfield shortly for #LFC v #Arsenal. Am I alone in expecting a goal-fest?      (Cue 0-0 ...)
 Mascherano to start for #LFC v Arsenal: Reina, Johnson, Carragher, Skrtel, Agger; Mascherano, Gerrard; Kuyt, Cole, Jovanovic; Ngog 
 Manuel Almunia is in goal for #Arsenal at Anfield. What's more, he's captain. And Jack Wilshere starts 
 #Arsenal XI v #LFC: Almunia; Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Clichy; Eboue, Nasri, Diaby, Wilshere, Arshavin; Chamakh 
 Prediction time: lots of goals, #LFC win. Good time to play #Arsenal without Song, Fabregas, Van Persie, new keeper 
 #Arsenal far more composed so far. Nasri seeing plenty of the ball, Koscielny assured on debut. #LFC can't keep the ball 
Nightmare debut for Joe Cole. Sent off for lunge at Koscielny by corner flag after 45 anonymous mins. #LFC #Arsenal
 What a goal by David Ngog to beat Almunia at near post, 59 secs into second half. #LFC 1 #Arsenal 0 
89 min 39 secs: Arsenal equalise with Reina OG. Chamakh header comes back off the post and shovelled in by Reina. #LFC 1 #Arsenal 1
 FT: Liverpool 1 Arsenal 1. Entertaining stuff (and two red cards), with both teams exhibiting familiar failings 
 So Fulham have rejected a second Arsenal bid for Schwarzer. I prefer Given, but still think Schwarzer deal will happen 
 Arsenal target Sebastien Squillaci not playing for Sevilla v Barcelona in Spanish Super Cup tmrw, which suggests ... 
 Interesting: acc to @NeilAshton_NOTW, Arsenal target Schwarzer has   failed fitness test   and out of Fulham v #MUFC 
 86 min: Stockdale saves Nani penalty to keep it 2-1. Who needs Schwarzer? (Arsenal, supposedly, but that's another story) 
 #MCFC running their   celebration of the season   awards on the big screen. Adebayor v Arsenal is on the shortlist ... 
Not sure Arsenal will relish being in same group as Shakhtar Donetsk. Horrible 3-0 defeat there ten years ago
Chelsea get Spartak Moscow as well as Marseille. Arsenal get Braga as well as Shakhtar. Ajax in with Milan and Real
 FC Twente join Spurs, Inter, Werder Bremen in Group A. Arsenal get Partizan Belgrade, Shakhtar, Braga #UCL

85 min: #Chelsea 2 #Arsenal 0. Alex scores with a thunderbolt of a free kick #CFC #AFC

 #Chelsea asst manager Ray Wilkins full of praise for #Arsenal, but said that #CFC battling qualities the difference 
 @TheChelseaBlog Arsenal missed some very good chances, free headers etc. Final score unjust, but it's a familiar story for them v Chelsea 
 @OleGunner Agree. Difference today is that Arsenal's best chances came at 0-0. Had Chelsea on the ropes briefly, but then same old story 
Chelsea say Alex is out for 3 wks with thigh injury sustained after (when?) he scored that incredible free kick v Arsenal

 @TheArsenal_ Not aware of Arsenal having written to FA re Eduardo/Ramsey. If they did, they certainly didn't announce it 
RT @neiljjones: Keith Edelman (former director at Arsenal) has also shown up at the #LFC board meeting
Bad start for #MCFC at home to Arsenal. Boyata sent off for professional foul on Chamakh on edge of box
#Arsenal 1-0 up. Nice move (Nasri-Arshavin-Nasri) and composed finish from Nasri
We've now seen both Arshavin and Nasri winning tackles by their own corner flag in first half-hour. #Arsenal mean business
 #Arsenal four bookings in first 35 mins: Denilson, Fabregas, Song, Djourou. Wenger not happy, but it's been that type of game so far 
Joe Hart superb penalty save from Fabregas 40 mins to keep scoreline #MCFC 0 #Arsenal 1
66 mins #MCFC 0 #Arsenal 2. Alex Song with fierce first-time shot after City interception fell to him
 88 min: Bendtner, on as sub, finishes well to make it #MCFC 0 #Arsenal 3. Fantastic result for Arsenal 
 @mather23 Nani has come on superbly, but I don't think his best performance (Arsenal away?) comes close to Bale's last nt. Just my opinion 
 In past 12 months Van Persie has played as many games (8) for Holland as for Arsenal. Wenger entitled to   moan   about call-up for friendly 
@MattFitchett Van Persie original injury came on intl duty last Nov. 8 games for Arsenal since. Wenger entitled to question friendly call-up
 Early goals for #LFC at #Wigan, #Arsenal at #Wolves, #Rovers at #NUFC. Expecting things to be cagier here at #MCFC v #MUFC 
 36 min: Everton 0 Arsenal 1. Nasr shot saved, Arshavin laid ball off, Sagna fierce (make that very fierce) shot past Howard at near post 
 48 min: Everton 0 Arsenal 2. Denilson to Chamakh to Fabregas, low first-time shot swept into the corner 
 88m 37s: 15 mins of Everton pressure pays off with goal from Cahill, hooked home from close range. Everton 1 Arsenal 2 
 FT Everton 1 Arsenal 2. Strange game. Arsenal 2-0 up without hitting top gear. Everton took 75 mins to get going, then had Arsenal on ropes 
 Arsenal   crisis   par for course. Living up/down to expect'ns. Still lack experience/nous/bottle/winners. Will still challenge on all fronts 
 Football webchat at 1pm for Times subscribers, £1 trialists. Link to follow later. Anything to get off your chest? Arsenal fans maybe? 
 And away from the Fifa swamp, you might just find a rare interview with Arsenal boy wonder @jack_wilshere in tmrw's Times 
Meant to post this yday. Jack Wilshere interview ://bit.ly/euXUbd (subscription). Arsenal players donating day's wages to @CentrepointUK
#Arsenal XI v Partizan: Fabianski; Sagna Koscielny Squillac Gibbs; Song Denilson; Nasri Van Persie Arshavin; Chamakh
 Have to feel for Kieran Gibbs, who lasts just 24 mins for Arsenal v Partizan. Eboue on. 0-0 and Arsenal a little nervous 
Arsenal 1-0. Van Persie pen 30
 52 min: Arsenal 1 Partizan 1. Cleo shot deflected in off Squillaci, who had initially stood off him. Nervous again for Arsenal 
Arsenal 2-1. Walcott well-taken goal soon after coming on for Arshavin
 Arsenal possible last 16 opponents: Barcelona, Real, Bayern, Schalke. Chelsea oppts: Inter, Lyon, Valencia, Copenhagen, Roma, Milan 
 I love Evra's willingness to speak his mind, so rare in sportsmen today, but can't help feeling he's disrespected league leaders Arsenal 
 More Evra on Arsenal:   They're a football training centre. There are no trophies, there is nothing.   
#MUFC 1 #Arsenal 0. United usually win tight games against their competitors. Arsenal don't. Not a coincidence
 Wenger was asked why Arsenal rarely win big games:   You're a football specialist. I leave that analysis to you because you know everything   
 At risk of antagonising non-subscribers ... webchat here imminently ://bit.ly/eVTN9b (Tevez, Blackburn, Arsenal etc) 
 @johnmcfadian Nasri a poor man's Iniesta? Is that meant to be a criticism? I've always thought Arsenal flattered by   Barcelona Lite   tag 
Total wages of 12 SPL clubs is £109m (via @STVGrant). #Chelsea #MCFC #MUFC #LFC #Arsenal all pay more than that on wages
Champions League last 16 draw contd: Lyon v Real Madrid; Arsenal v Barcelona
 @ashaltot @cjhancock #LFC need a visionary in the same way Arsenal did in 1996. They might not find a Wenger, but they have to look for one 
 And in other news, Leeds have just gone 1-0 up at Arsenal. Snodgrass pen 
 I don't like to kick players when they're down, but ... Wayne Bridge: worst debut I've seen in years. Arsenal 3-0. Hugely at fault x3 
 Arsenal excellent. No one ever doubted their ability to play like this, but no team better at rubbing salt in opponents' wounds. Poor Avram 
@RobHickton @MWatson91 @jonesmark85 Denilson suggested that Arsenal lack genuine on-pitch leadership and that Cesc isn't a natural leader
 Owen Coyle i/view ://thetim.es/hBGy8e (£) Discusses his philosophy, #BWFC, Burnley, Arsenal, drinking gravy, swimming 
@JoshKSM Arsenal certainly in contention. Hard to regard them as favourites though
 Blackpool lead 2-0 #MUFC. Can't match that drama here, but Ipswich, not Arsenal, going to the final as things stand. 37 min: 0-0 (0-1 agg) 
 HT: Arsenal 0 Ipswich 0 (agg 0-1). Arsenal playing the better football and creating half-chances, but Ipswich resilient so far 
Looks like Theo Walcott coming on at half-time for Arsenal. No surprise. Need more pace/penetration down the flanks
 61 min: Arsenal 1-0 (agg 1-1). Wilshere pass, Bendtner beat offside trap, cut inside and curled low shot into far corner. Excellent goal 
Arsenal 2-0 (agg 2-1). Koscielny header from corner
Fabregas 3-0 (agg 3-1). Arsenal heading to Wembley
 Arsenal increasingly nervous until they scored, but comfortable in the end. Shades of Partizan game last month. A trophy should calm them 
 @braddulay Between them Chelsea and Utd have won 5 of last 6 Carling Cups. Their fans enjoyed it, so I'm sure Arsenal's (or Bham/WH's) would 
 Alex McLeish:   Arsenal will be favourites and probably have been for a few rounds now, but we'll try to cause an upset   #BCFC 
FA Cup draw (contd): Leyton Orient v Arsenal; Everton/Chelsea v Reading; Man Utd v Crawley!!!
@DarrenArsenal1 @1979gooner You're wrong. Everyone points out how little Arsenal spend. But usually as a criticism ...
#MUFC v Crawley live on ITV at 5.15pm on Sat Feb 19. Leyton Orient v Arsenal on ESPN at 4.30pm the following day
 Wilshere completed 27/29 passes in 45 mins. Excellent rate but not like playing for Arsenal (more of the ball, others on same wavelength) 
 @Colinko True, like Arsenal being from Woolwich. But that was then. (Orient also considered moving to Harlow (!) a few yrs ago. But didn't) 
 Barça hard done by (and a brilliant, brilliant team) but when Arsenal let a lead slip like that in Prem Lge, they get panned ... 
@Chris_Faulkner @ragingbitch I wasn't talking about Newc game. Talking more generally about games where Arsenal wasteful/unlucky/careless
 In other words, boot was on the other foot for Arsenal tonight. They were outpassed & had some luck, but they looked braver/hungrier at end 
@SOLeary84 Of course Xavi IS better than Wilshere and of course Barça ARE better than Arsenal. But game changed in final 15 mins. It happens
Leyton Orient v Arsenal teamsheet #lofc #afc ://twitpic.com/41w9iq
 FA Cup QF draw was just read out at Orient. Loud roar from home fans, excited by trip to Old Trafford.   Only   Arsenal in the way 
What a goal! Jonathan Tehoue scores a stunning late equaliser for Orient against Arsenal
@_Tahseinur_ Well spotted. Must be an anti-Arsenal agenda. Either that or my internet connection was down for most of the game.
 @IamTils Sorry. Missed the derby as I was on a 400-mile round trip to London for Orient-Arsenal. So #lazyLondonjournos, yep ... 
 Fixture news in a nutshell: if you support United, Arsenal, City, Chelsea or Spurs, most of your April league games have been moved for TV 
#ff @domfifield @MattLawExpress @johncrossmirror @LaurensJulien @DWhiteFootball @henrywinter. Because they're sitting next to me at Arsenal
Arsenal haunted lack of authority and experience at the back - maybe lack of trophy-winning experience too. Back 5 looked nervous throughout
 @pbxl @steauneedarest @nickwastell Lack of trophies has played on Arsenal minds, as Sagna said. B'ham under no such pressure - as was clear 
 @AGT79 Arsenal lack authority and experience at the back. Not saying it's easily remedied, but how can you disagree with that assessment? 
@AGT79 Apologise? For regarding the Szczesny/Fabianksi/Almunia-Djourou/Koscielny/Squillaci axis as Arsenal's weakness?
 Arsenal confirm Robin van Persie has flown to Barcelona and is in squad for tmrw's game, having previously been ruled out 
Van Persie starts for Arsenal. Diaby and Wilshere in central midfield with Fabregas ahead of them
RT @johncrossmirror: #Barcelona v #Arsenal team sheet ://twitpic.com/47jcpq
Almunia coming on for Szczesny after 18 mins. Szczesny injured finger saving Alves free kick. Not what Arsenal wanted 0-0
Inevitable Arsenal recriminations after some poor refereeing from the usually excellent Busacca. But Barca really are in a different class
 @GazzettaCalcio That's what I said, ie Barca in a different class. Simply pointing out what Arsenal were focusing on 
 @AnthonyCalder You're an Arsenal fan, no doubt supportive of their philosophy, and you think Barça are/were   s**t  ? Forgive me if I disagree 
 Leaving Barcelona. Some sympathy with Arsenal, but best team won. Not convinced red card outweighed ref errors in Arsenal favour in 1st leg 
 @ChemicalBarry Two things won't change regardless of what Arsenal end up with: 1 Wenger has the odd blind spot, 2 Wenger is perfect for them 
 Webchat starting very shortly (subs or £1) ://thetim.es/h5Ewts Barca-Arsenal, Spurs-Milan, media   witch-hunts   etc... 
And yes they had an easier draw than Arsenal (AC Milan easy? only comparatively) but they earned that by winning a tougher group
RT @ftw997: @OliverKayTimes blatantly supporting spurs and slagging off arsenal. Biased much? --> Erm. No. Which of us is being objective?
@EirikHOP No. You need to realise that praising Spurs for reaching QF and praising Barca for being rather good doesn't make me anti-Arsenal
 Fergie (in reasonable mood) confirms Nani out for #MUFC v Arsenal tie tmrw, outside chance back for Bolton next wk 
 7 defenders, VDS, Gibson, Rooney and Hernandez start for #MUFC v Arsenal. Presume Fabio, O'Shea and maybe Rafael in midfield 
Chamakh on for Denilson. Arsenal plenty of possession but little punch up front so far and vulnerable to counter-attack. 61 min 2-0
Djourou stretchered off - and applauded by whole crowd. Day doesn't get any better for Arsenal. 86 min 2-0 for Utd
 United fans singing (about Arsenal)   You're just a s**t Barcelona  . Not the worst insult I've ever heard 
 FT 2-0. Strange match. Another trophy disappears from Arsenal horizon. So much possession, but no way past VdS. Fergie selection pays off 
@TonyEvansTimes That stat that shocked me was only 10 fouls. Was that really a United-Arsenal FA Cup quarter-final?
 Millennium Stadium was/is great. Didn't propose that (or Villa, Newc, Sund, Arsenal) as I presumed distance to be a main objection 
 Jens Lehmann back to Arsenal at 41 as emergency GK cover and   healthy   competition with his old buddy Manuel Almunia 
@MattLawExpress It's on the wires. I'll be accused of bias if I don't tweet Arsenal injury news after tweeting United update this morning...
 @dazbentleybfc Would love to, but I'll be on way to Spurs v Arsenal. Will pass it on 
@Shazad_S Because United consistently get results when the pressure is on. Arsenal don't
 @JasonAStein There shouldn't even be a debate. He has his blind spots, but he's perfect for Arsenal 
 @Volumiser_AFC Which part do you disagree with? Do you feel Arsenal have a   fantastic mentality  ? I can't agree, but hey ho 
Bolton v Arsenal teamsheet. Wilshere back for Arsenal.  ://plixi.com/p/95527188
48 min: Van Persie equalises for Arsenal at the Reebok. Excellent goal after Szczesny penalty save from Davies (shouldn't have been a pen)
From today's paper: Bolton-Arsenal report ://thetim.es/foyFaY £ and a column on Torres ://thetim.es/fYbU3S £
 @samuelruback I can't imagine Arsenal spending time on set-piece drills. Nor Barcelona, in fairness, but they don't play in Premier Lge... 
 @samuelruback I would agree that. Must be infuriating for Arsenal fans, but I'd still warn dissenters to be careful what they wish for ... 
 @JCdaGUNNER Their protest song with obvious subtext, was simply   Dalglish  . But Hodgson at LFC vs Wenger at Arsenal. Slight difference ... 
Confirmed #MUFC XI v Arsenal: VDS; Fabio Ferdinand Vidic Evra; Nani Carrick Anderson Park; Rooney Hernandez
 Word from the Arsenal camp is that Fabregas out after getting a   kick on the thigh   in training on Sat 
1-0 for Arsenal. Aaron Ramsey
 Michael Owen for Carrick. #MUFC now playing 4-2-4, with Park and Rooney the midfield two. Arsenal lead 1-0 86 mins 
@Red_Red_Devil He did. And Wenger acknowledged Arsenal lucky with Clichy/Owen too. Amazing ...
 @Red_Red_Devil So if Spurs have a top-four squad this season, where's the gatecrasher? Chelsea? City? Arsenal? United? 
 If the stats on Wilshere's season are conclusive proof of one thing, it's that Arsenal have overplayed him while knowing FA intentions 
 Nearly every Arsenal fan says   well he's our player, we'll play him when we want  . It's true. But it also shows self-interest on both sides 
Debate always so polarised. Arsenal fans respond like I proposed melting down Herbert Chapman's bust to make a bracelet for Stuart Pearce...
@srgDCFC @garyprince @Pandaman_cometh I wasn't particularly thinking about Arsenal. Sunderland maybe. Bolton if sell Cahill. Villa ...
 @oligoldstein If you'd asked me in March, I'd have said Nasri will sign new deal with Arsenal. Far from convinced of that now 
 No need for a guessing game. Fergie is 100% referring to #MCFC when he suggests   somewhere else   as Nasri destination if he leaves Arsenal 
 @Blue_tintedPred @obalagun Are you suggesting we have a pro-Barca, pro-Spurs, anti-Chelsea, anti-Arsenal press? Every deal is different 
@CharlieB_gooner But do Arsenal have the players to play 4-4-2? Personally I think Walcott on right suits him and suits the team
@timpayton et al ... I know Arsenal and others (incl City) have invested in community for years. Latest MCFC project raises bar considerably
 Arsenal fans ... Re the infamous Xavi   Cesc is suffering   interview? Was it genuinely on Barca official site? Anyone have a link? Thanks 
Arsenal/Fabregas column ://thetim.es/pQfZ2a and big Swansea piece ://thetim.es/oNqH9i from today's paper (£)
 @MickTheGooner @Silts81 Arsenal entitled to ask for £40m, Barca entitled to bid £30m. But after 14 mths, time for Barca to put up or shut up 
 @Chelcfc Think Arsenal do recognise and have accepted that, but they'd be wrong to cave in and sell for £30m 
 Arsenal potential opponents in Champions League play-off draw: FC Twente, Rubin Kazan, Udinese, FC Zurich, Odense 
 And interestingly, 6 out of 7 tipped Arsenal to stay in top four - same as for Chelsea. Two backing #LFC for top four 
 Arsenal confirm signing of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Southampton get £12m guaranteed, further £3m worth of add-ons 
 Accept all arguments re potential, resale etc, but odd that Arsenal pay so much for an unproven winger yet won't pay it for proven defenders 
 Nicklas Bendtner on a move away from Arsenal:   hopefully it will be sorted out soon  . Busy few weeks of ins/outs ahead at Emirates 
 Huge few weeks ahead for Arsenal. And Wilshere out of #NUFC game on Sat, doubtful for Udinese 1st leg. More in Thursday's Times 
 @Trickya25 I won't overdo it, but I don't think you'd find many Arsenal fans who would refute that the next few weeks are hugely challenging 
 Right, going to bed now. Got Wenger press conf early tmrw. And, as I said 24 hrs ago, @JackWilshere added to Arsenal injury list. Not good 
 & if you're interested, my info is no deal yet agreed between #MCFC and Arsenal for Nasri. Only a matter of time, but doubt in time for Mon 
 On way to Arsenal press conference. Any questions for Arsene Wenger, dare I ask? 
 Must say I find extent of *some* Arsenal fans' anger towards Wenger very surprising. Frustration understandable, but deserves more respect 
 @SiLoMaKaFuS As far as I can see, the only ones writing off Wenger are some sections of Arsenal's support. I made clear my view on that 
 @markbounce I meant what I said: reality check for a number of teams. Liverpool are one, but also Blackburn, Arsenal, QPR ... 
Arsenal confirm sale of Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona. Statement here ://bit.ly/oPANYm 
 FA to study video of #NUFC v Arsenal today. Strong possibility Song charged for stamp. The brawl will also be looked at, clubs poss charged 
@dickmowbray I'd agree with the contrast (have said same myself) but Arsenal didn't have the option of both right price and right timing
 As @SamWallaceIndy writes today, Van Persie, Walcott and Song less than 2 yrs on contracts. Arsenal cannot allow repeat of Nasri situation 
 Alex Song charged by FA over Barton stamp. Newcastle and Arsenal charged with   failing to control their players  . No action against Barton 
 @richardjmorris I've criticised and questioned AW as much as anyone over that time, but I'm staggered to think any Arsenal fan wants him out 
@OllieHoltMirror Point taken? You must be in a rush ... See you at Arsenal
Gervinho three-match suspension upheld by FA. Arsenal appeal fails ---> RT @thefadotcom: Gervinho appeal outcome here bit.ly/ocHjlR
 Arsenal increasingly depleted. Next 4: Udinese h, #LFC h, Udinese a, #MUFC a. Threatens to get worse before it gets better - which it will 
1-0 for Arsenal. Walcott. That should settle any nerves
Very important save by Szczesny after Asamoah ran 50+ yards with the ball. Always looked like he would save it. 28 min: Arsenal 1-0
Arsenal claim they were given permission on Mon for Wenger to communicate with bench via Boro Primorac. Uefa say that wasn't the agreement
Arsenal can expect a Uefa fine for not staging post-match press conference. Probably about the same paltry figure clubs get for racial abuse
Arsenal injuries: Gibbs and Djourou (both hamstrings) doubtful for #LFC on Sat. Wilshere already struggling. Gervinho (and prob Song) banned
@OrangSoul He has a point in that (acc to Arsenal) Uefa contradicted themselves b/w what was said on Monday and what was said on the night
 Uefa start fresh disciplinary case against Wenger for   not abiding by   terms of touchline ban. Arsenal blame mixed messages from Uefa 
RT @JackWilshere: Been at Arsenal since i was 9 and this is how they spell my name! LOL! ://yfrog.com/klhaaroj 
 Great result for #LFC, winning 2-0 at Arsenal. Underlines Arsenal's problems. Backing Wenger will sort things out, but maybe not this week 
Interesting stuff RT @sportingintel: REVEALED: The table that shows Arsenal and Blackpool were cheated last season ://j.mp/oB8P8R
 Juan Mata confirms he's on his way to London (which means Chelsea, not Arsenal).  RT @juanmata10: Travel to London for medical examination 
 Redknapp on Modric:   I'm sure he'll stay  . And -- Arsenal fans will love this -- on Nasri:   He's gonna go   
 More replies than I can handle tonight. I've got to sleep - early flight to Italy for Arsenal game. Not being ignorant, just tired ... Sorry 
@Arsenalman2011 I've heard more criticism of Wenger from Arsenal fans than from media this summer. Same applies to Redknapp at Spurs
 FA confirm Arsenal and Newcastle both fined £30,000 for   failing to control their players   in this month's Premier League match 
 @ElmoRed2011 @JZrenz Haven't heard that directly, but I'm with Arsenal in Italy. You're better off asking @TonyBarretTimes 
Confirmed Arsenal XI v Udinese: Szczesny; Jenkinson Djourou Vermaelen Sagna; Song Frimpong; Walcott Ramsey Gervinho; Van Persie
 Anxious start for Arsenal in Udine. Good going forward, but extremely vulnerable at the back. Sagna strugglng at left back. 25 mins 0-0 
 Incredibly open game. Amazed it's 0-0 after 35 min. Gervinho excellent for Arsenal, but Udinese's midfield and attack so quick and dangerous 
1-0 for Udinese. Di Natale beautiful header. It had been coming. Now let's see what Arsenal are made of
Half-time: Udinese 1 Arsenal 0 (agg 1-1). Arsenal on the ropes
 55 min: Udinese 1 Arsenal 1 (agg 1-2). Van Persie scores after another great run from Gervinho. Huge relief for Arsenal, but can't relax 
2-1 for Arsenal! Walcott charges away down the left and finishes in style. 3-1 on aggregate now. Arsenal look safe. Relief for Wenger
 Excellent 2nd-half performance from Arsenal. Very pleased for Wenger. Still got some holes that need plugging, but tonight should lift mood 
 Uefa rankings observation 1: Liverpool are still ranked 5th (ahead of Arsenal, Real, Inter and Milan) but didn't qualify this year 
 Uefa rankings observation 1: Liverpool are still ranked 5th (ahead of Arsenal, Real, Inter and Milan) but didn't qualify this year 
Man Utd drawn in same group as Benfica. Arsenal drawn in same group as Marseille. Chelsea (Mata) in same group as Valencia. More to follow
Man City join Bayern Munich and Villarreal in Group A. Olympiakos join Arsenal and Marseille in Group F
 @chasmanu Because there were already two English clubs (Chelsea and Arsenal) in that half of the draw, so City had to go into Group A 
 Arsenal group confirmed with Marseille, Olympiakos and Borussia Dortmund. Chelsea group confirmed with Valencia, Bayer Leverkusen and Genk 
 @StivoUtrecht @egerton_lee There were already two English clubs (Chelsea & Arsenal) in that half of the draw, so City had to go into Group A 
 @Robbiechap No, I didn't expect Arsenal to. I meant Villa, Everton (if only they the money), potentially Spurs 
 Capello sounds keen on Emmanuel Frimpong, who's also eligible for Ghana:   If he plays for a short time with Arsenal, I will select him   
At Old Trafford. #MUFC keep same team that beat Spurs 3-0. Arsenal team to follow
Arsenal XI v #MUFC: Szczesny; Jenkinson Djourou Koscielny Traore; Coquelin Ramsey; Walcott Rosicky Arshavin; Van Persie
@GunnerArchitect ha. Because I've always imagined American football got there first idea with #AFC. And #Arsenal wouldn't abbreviate it
Just managed to get online for the first time since before kick-off. You didn't miss much. It finished Man Utd 8 Arsenal 2. Pretty standard
@JC_WINK One more than Arsenal had yesterday ...
 @GMac054 Situation at Arsenal, a bigger club, is more extreme. Both are under pressure but you won't find me calling for either to be sacked 
@DoronSalomon @samuelluckhurst There need to be more b******ings at Arsenal. But they'd sound better coming from someone with experience
 Arsenal confirm they've agreed to sign Per Mertesacker   subject to the completion of formal registration processes  

://thetim.es/n3iQoZ  
 As @DickinsonTimes just said, Mikel Arteta to Arsenal is looking very likely. Arsenal have bid £10m. Everton haggling 
@EddieCuthbert @tb_17 @DjimiTraore @Drewfus82 @bananaman777 @Dom7Wilson @Novello2001 @alexjohnson40x @MattyN18 It was Arteta/Arsenal ...
 Arteta Part 3: Would fit in well at Arsenal if it happens. Premier League experience, composure, intelligence, lovely passer 
 Chelsea confirm Benayoun is joining Arsenal on season-long loan. @YossiBenayoun15:   I sign with Arsenal, very happy and excited about it   
 Firmly expecting confirmation of Meireles to Chelsea, Arteta to Arsenal in the next hour 
 Or the next minute ... Meireles to Chelsea done at £12m, 4-yr deal. Arteta to Arsenal is complete too 
Arsenal.com appears to have crashed. In a transfer window -- normally its quietest time ...
 Rubbing it in: Barca's J-M Bartomeu re Cesc:   It was a v good deal for us. His real price was what Arsenal initially asked - at least €60m   
 Uefa also fine Arsenal £10,000 for   improper conduct by their officials   v Udinese. Now let's see if Uefa similarly tough on racism 
 @robgoodwin_ Can say that of any manager. Utd, Arsenal in transition when Mourinho arrived. Liverpool in decline when Fergie won first title 
@Longyman I think that applies to Arsenal too
 Full time: Blackburn 4 Arsenal 3. Brilliant game. Arsenal 2-1 up, then 4-2 down. Still no defensive discipline. Great win for Rovers 
@Amar_arsenal123 I don't think there's vitriol towards Arsenal at all. I hear/read far more vitriol from Arsenal fans than from media
@bestasaswagger I'd say Spurs in a far better state post Aug 31 than before. Not like-for-like. Arsenal should be stronger post Aug 31 too
 HT: Man Utd 3 (Smalling, Nani, Rooney) Chelsea 0. #MUFC fans singing   Are you Arsenal in disguise?   ... 
 Good to hear Ivan Gazidis spelling out that Arsenal are   lucky to have   Wenger and he   shouldn't be worried   re job security. He's right 
 @stovemonster If you can read my @replies, you'll see a worrying number of Arsenal fans trying to tell me his time is up 
 @theN5er Are you an Arsenal fan? And you refer to Wenger as   this sucker  ? I find that astonishing 
 @mattwing79 You're probably right, like if Torres or Carroll miss a chance or Arsenal commit defensive blunders.   ABU   media, you see ... 
 Van Persie says no urgency over his contract, which expires at end of next season. After Nasri mess, Arsenal need to tie him down quickly 
Back at Manchester airport after a lively evening in Munich. Surely Arsenal v Olympiakos tmrw will be more straightforward. Surely...
Arsenal XI v Olympiakos: Szczesny; Sagna Song Mertesacker Santos; Frimpong Arteta; Arshavin Rosicky Oxlade-Chamberlain; Chamakh
 Presentation made in Emirates Stadium press room to legendary football writer Brian Glanville, 80 last wk. Saw his 1st Arsenal game in 1942 
 Arsenal 1-0 up against Olympiakos after 8 mins. Goal very well taken by 18-year-old Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, making Champions League debut 
Andre Santos makes it 2-0 for Arsenal against Olympiakos
2-1. David Fuster pulls a goal back for Olympiakos. Arsenal slack defending from a corner. Olympiakos deserve that
@Sawyer_Arsenal Ah. I meant HE saw his first Arsenal game in 1942. I saw mine in 1983. It wasn't at Highbury
 Doesn't feel like it, but that was Arsenal's 3rd straight win in all comps. Performance far from convincing, but finally momentum, of sorts 
 @Abd_al_Rahman79 Ah, Chelsea you mean? I didn't see that. Only seen the goals. I'm at Arsenal 
 @GeezerNo1UK It's funny. With Arsenal, journos are never sure whether it's praise or criticism that will get them most grief from fans ... 
 @JPBIndy I'd say it's a bit of everything, wouldn't you? Chelsea ad Stoke both created an awful lot of openings. Even Arsenal did 
 On train to Spurs v Arsenal. Staggered by HT score at the Reebok: Bolton 0 Chelsea 4. Wowsers, as Joe Hart would say 
 @StuartMawhinney Been thinking the same. That didn't work out too badly, although LFC under Houllier defended a lot deeper than Arsenal do 
Half-time at White Hart Lane. Spurs 1-0 up. Think Adebayor has run more over past 45 mins than in his final year at Arsenal
 Bale and Parker excellent for Spurs today. Parker isn't a world-beater, but he would have given Arsenal a little of what they lack 
 Having said that, Arsenal are lacking all over the pitch at the moment. Didn't show enough urgency/creativity after equalising 
 Bad news for Arsenal re Sagna. Wenger says they're   very worried   about his injury. He's at hospital now. Update later 
Now confirmed by @Arsenal that Bacary Sagna has broken his fibula and is out for 3 months.
Spurs-Arsenal match report ://thetim.es/qysxs8  ratings ://thetim.es/qXowGr  and column on Dalglish ://thetim.es/numDnJ  (£)
 @JamesSethOwens @ChrisPhillips11 Three of next 4 games are away (Arsenal, Bolton, Man Utd). Not going to be easy to find breathing space 
What a free kick by Van Persie. 2-1 for Arsenal. Eight mins left
 Arsenal beat Sunderland 2-1 with two goals from Van Persie. Arsenal now tenth, Sunderland a nervous 17th 
 Wenger:   Players go to MCFC because they pay much better than Arsenal  . Certainly true re Adebayor/Toure, but ambition a factor with Nasri 
 @steview81 I hate to say this Stephen, but they've won more trophies (one) than Arsenal since 2005 and will win more this season 
 Arsenal fans objecting to my suggestion that ambition   a   (not   the  ) factor in Nasri move. Surely you must see difference b/w 2009 and now 
@LucaHelvetica Absolutely. He and others weak when the pressure was on. Showed Arsenal (collectively as well as individually) to be lacking
@JB888 Because for the past 2 seasons Arsenal have challenged for title and City haven't. Tables have turned now
 @Arsenal_DNA Not   destined for mediocrity   no. I like the Arsenal philosophy, but I think City are now better placed to compete for trophies 
Some good news for Arsenal. Thomas Vermaelen signs new four-year contract. Now to sort out Van Persie ....
 Unusual quote from Vermaelen:   Arsenal is a fantastic club. We have great supporters, we’re doing well financially and ...[etc]   
 Chelsea win 5-0 (Meireles, Torres 2, Ivanovic, Kalou). Arsenal 's last-gasp 1-0 win in Marseille a huge result for them 
 @Donnie_Dusko An awful lot of clear chances being created by United's visitors - not just City but Chelsea, Norwich, Basel, even Arsenal 
Following Arsenal AGM via Twitter. Follow @JWTelegraph @RorySmith_Indy @DarrenArsenal1 @timpayton @JamesOlley as Kroenke breaks silence
 Kroenke backs Wenger -> RT @JamesOlley:   Arsenal has a wonderful manager ... who makes great decisions ... and has a tremendous following.   
 Response from CFC chairman Bruce Buck:   I can only hope that on Sat we all get together, support this club and beat the c**p out of Arsenal   
 @ColKilKel Chap. You know ...   beat the chap out of Arsenal   
 Good stat in Times: total costs of Chelsea's, Liverpool's and Man City's subs at w/e: £282m. Good job no Tevez. Man Utd c £65m. Arsenal £24m 
1-0 for Arsenal. Van Persie header after superb run down the left from Alex Song
 Fairly comfortable for Arsenal by the end, 2-1 win with another two for Van Persie. But Chelsea losing from 1-0 up in Leverkusen? Dearie me 
 Three Eng teams struggling in Champions League this season, which makes Arsenal's progression, with a game to spare, all the more impressive 
 A lot of people telling me Arsenal had an easy group. Dortmund, Olympiakos, Marseille? I've seen a lot easier this season 
 @DanielNotaro The only people I heard saying Wenger should be sacked in August were Arsenal fans - the stupid ones, not the sensible ones 
@BaselGooner I'd say City had the toughest group of the English teams - you'd expect that as 3rd seeds - and then Arsenal
 Wenger when asked if surprised that Arsenal the only English team through so far:   Yes ........ I have to be very cautious in what I say...   
@1979gooner Someone else just said that to me. I'd say the same applies - much more so in fact - to a lot of Arsenal fans
@Savinator1985 Why do you say the media idolise Arsenal? Most Arsenal fans say the media hate them. Both views are entirely wrong of course
 @TommyMHFC I'd say it's roughly even, yes. I was just disagreeing with those who said Arsenal were in an   easy   group 
@TommyMHFC I thought Udinese were excellent and unfortunate against Arsenal. Best of the four teams Arsenal have played imho
 @DaleGrey_AFC For all but a few of last 20 years or so, Arsenal unquestionably more successful than LFC yes. Why is this even being debated? 
 @randomanomaly And personally, I'd rather see the Arsenal clock keep ticking then get reset. (That's pro Wenger, not anti-Arsenal ...) 
 @johncrossmirror It's not really a love-in. I think he's a good appointment for #SAFC. I don't think he would be right for MUFC, Arsenal etc 
 @samuelruback I'd agree with you, but wouldn't you say those extremes are also reflected in views of many Arsenal fans in good/bad times? 
@Arsenal_Ratings A majority of headlines reflected difficulties (which were genuine). I don't remember any journo saying he should go

Samir Nasri and Kolo Toure start for #MCFC v former club Arsenal
 HT: Man City 0 Arsenal 0. Decent game so far - tight, but decent. City trying to find breakthrough. Arsenal working hard, defending well 
Arsenal bringing on Ignasi Miquel 90 seconds into second half. Djourou limps off as the full-back crisis reaches the stopgaps
FT: #MCFC 1 #Arsenal 0. City restore 2-point lead at top. Excellent game. Arsenal pushed City a lot harder than most teams have this season
 @MattLawExpress Ah, that's different. Thierry has Arsenal in his DNA ... 
@shaunkrish It was a little joke about Barcelona's laments about their right to sign Cesc. Paranoid Arsenal fans misinterpreting it as a dig

 Milan v Arsenal teamsheet. Rosicky starts, Oxlade-Chamberlain on bench. Gibbs returns pic.twitter.com/cArYX0Wd 
 Brilliant, brilliant comeback by Arsenal, from 0-2 down to 5-2 up against Spurs. For Spurs, it's becoming a Downfall parody of a game 
 @DarrenJHanks Quite right. But it can sometimes be a catalyst to better things, just as missing out (eg Arsenal last season) can deflate 
Is FA chairman David Bernstein a jinx for Redknapp? He was at Arsenal yday and Stevenage last wk. Good job he gave Southwark Crown Ct a miss
 Getting a lot of Arsenal fans demanding that Bale dive gets acres of newsprint. Sorry, but on a day when you beat Spurs 5-2, it's a footnote 
@TheArsenal_ @jagsy10 Plenty was said about Rooney dive. But an Arsenal defeat and a tunnel bust-up were deemed more *shocking* than a dive
 @MoHoopsN5 Then we can't win. Arsenal fans complaining yesterday about lack of discussion of Bale dive, Redknapp tactics in morning papers

#NUFC XI v Arsenal: Krul; Simpson Williamson Coloccini Santon; Obertan Tiote Cabaye Gutierrez; Ben Arfa; Ba
Two goals in a minute at Arsenal. Newcastle take 1-0 lead through Hatem Ben Arfa. Then Van Persie equalises from Walcott cross
 Brilliant win for Arsenal, Vermaelen winner on 90+5 mins. 4th successive lge game they've come from behind to win 
 06/07, 07/08, 08/09: England provides nine Champions Lge semi-finalists out of 12. Four teams - Liverpool, Arsenal, Utd, Chelsea - at a peak

 Arsenal much the stronger start here. #MCFC flat, Yaya off injured. Balotelli awful challenge on Song not spotted. 22 min 0-0 
HT: Arsenal 0 #MCFC 0. Strong first 15 mins from Arsenal. #MCFC defending well and slowly stabilising - except for the obvious
84 min: Arsenal 0 #MCFC 0. City starting to look content with a point. I'm getting Steve Lomas and Alan Ball flashbacks
Full-time: Arsenal 1 #MCFC 0. #MCFC 8 points adrift. #MUFC closing in on No 20

@kdave_arsenal I don't really think they're good enough to have been able to choose this season. No more and no less than a strong cup team
Just received Footballer of the Year voting form. Six days to decide. RVP at front of my mind. And yes I realise Arsenal have won nothing...
 Another superb win for Wigan, 2-1 at Arsenal, to add to recent wins over LFC & MUFC. 5 pts clear of drop zone. Huge admiration for Martinez 
ie it will/would take something irresistible (prospect-wise and/or financially) for RVP to leave Arsenal. Juventus wouldn't fit bill

 A strange experience: on train to Wembley, through the countryside, following Arsenal-Norwich on Twitter. Sounds rather tense at Emirates... 
 Bad day for Arsenal. Didn't see it, but don't need to - whether they finish 3rd/4th/5th/6th, they're a flawed team and Wenger is rebuilding 
 @all_arsenal No. And I sympathise with anyone paying Emirates prices. But every time I go there, I'm entertained. An attractive, flawed team

 Good work Arsenal - lessons learned from last summer. Podolski and seemingly M'Vila signed, Bould assist mgr. Now for RVP contract talks ... 
@grumpy_gunner @Gingers4Limpar No idea whether  FA pay Arsenal or not - would be buttons if so - but they've had this arrangement since 2007

RVP situation messy. Told y'day Arsenal really don't want to sell to #MUFC unless for huge fee. #MUFC willing to pay £20m+? I'm sceptical
And Ferguson's comments last night are not exactly going to soften Arsenal's resolve on the matter. Utd aren't going to get him on the cheap
 @lasseHammer Agree. Arsenal shouldn't   bow down   - unless they think it's in their interests, which only a huge offer would be 
 @robshepherd5 I'm still not convinced United will pay £20m for him. And if Arsenal don't want to sell for less, why should they?

64 min: Liverpool 0 Arsenal 1. Arteta and Diaby doing well in midfield for #AFC. #LFC showing more urgency since Downing replaced Borini

@67AK Of course it's a great result for Arsenal. They beat their biggest rivals 5-2. How could it not be a great result?

 Dodgy wifi and bitterly cold, but quite a story unfolding at Bradford, where Arsenal trail 1-0 with 26 mins left in the @CapitalOne_Cup QF 
Bradford striker Nahki Wells leaves to a standing ovation. Vermaelen will be glad to see the back of him. Still Arsenal 1-0 down 76 min
 Arsenal knocked out of Capital One Cup on penalties by Bradford City, of League Two. Congratulations Bradford 
 @lovemylifelucky Very impressed by Bradford. Played with tenacity, spirit and intelligence even when Arsenal were dominating possession 
 Wenger:   We'll get over it. It's part of our club. It's what we do.   Really? Have Arsenal even got over 2011 Carling Cup final defeat yet? 
 @marklfc63 Agree with that. I frequently make that defence on AW's behalf, but I doubt anyone else would suggest Arsenal are mentally strong 
 Arsenal fans suggesting end of   Invincibles   run at Old Trafford in 04 and 2-2 at Birmingham in 08 as setbacks their team haven't   got over   
 @GrayTull I was saying that team didn't get over B'ham in 08. Now a new team, but   getting over   setbacks isn't an Arsenal trait these days 
@JamieMcKay17 No. I talked about Carling Cup final and I mentioned that others (Arsenal fans) had cited those previous two defeats.
@jeffnorthlondon Would you not agree that perhaps United are made of slightly stronger stuff than Arsenal?
I vote no. RT @TimesSport: Is it time for Arsene Wenger to leave #Arsenal? Vote here: ://thetim.es/12kATYQ  (£)
@stuc1981 I accept that. Prices at Arsenal too high. But few grounds have witnessed more thrilling football in recent yrs - just not lately

 @CBreward @gnev2   The man who has ruined Arsenal  ???! 
 At Madejski Stadium, where Reading fans amusing themselves with chants for old boy Phil Parkinson, whose Bradford team beat Arsenal last wk 
14 min: Arsenal lead 1-0 at Reading. Good control and finish by Podolski from Gibbs cross
 2-0 for Arsenal 32 mins. Podolski down the left, excellent cross to Cazorla, who scores with a diving header. Arsenal very comfortable 
3-0 for Arsenal. Cazorla 35 mins. Home fans not impressed. Reading outclassed
 Ten minutes ago it was Reading 0 Arsenal 4. It is now Reading 2 Arsenal 4. 19 mins to go. It couldn't happen, could it? 
 Alarmed by Reading's defending tonight, but Arsenal's attacking was impressively incisve. Cazorla, Podolski, Wilshere, Walcott excellent 
@AnthonyAshton1 I included that caveat. Do you really think Arsenal have had much praise this season?
@AnthonyAshton1 Definitely paranoia. Arsenal fans convinced world against them. You're both wrong ...
#ChampionsLeaguedraw Arsenal v Bayern Munich
 Four years ago, I would have strongly fancied #MUFC and Arsenal against Real and Bayern. Far, far less optimistic about English chances now 
@AnthonyFroom I always liked him in France. I was surprised United or Arsenal didn't sign him. Their loss should be Spurs' gain
 @RickGlanvill It's the fact that results are so skewed by interest groups (as shown re Chelsea, QPR, Arsenal) that I find most interesting 
 @RickGlanvill No. I said I found the polarisation of views re Chelsea, Arsenal, QPR owners interesting. Neither pole reflects my views 
Michu scores within a minute of coming to put Swansea 1-0 up against Arsenal. 57 min
 81 min - Excellent finish from Podolski, on the turn, to equalise for Arsenal at Swansea. I'd say they deserve that 
Another one! Gibbs scores to make it 2-1 for Arsenal
And now it's 2-2! Danny Graham equaliser for Swansea after Arsenal struggle to deal with a corner. Three mins plus stoppage time remaining
FT: Swansea 2 Arsenal 2. The final 25 mins showed best and worst of Arsenal. Swans didn't reach top form but threatened with every attack
 @samuelruback Threatened when they attacked, which might also say something about Arsenal's defence 
 Bradford leading Villa 1-0 as HT approaches in League Cup SF 1st leg at a packed Valley Parade.   Are you Arsenal in disguise?   home fans ask 
 @Romansbluearmy Personally I wouldn't fancy Arsenal's prospects if, on their budget, they had an Abramovich type calling the shots 
 @GrahameSDavis85 I know Arsenal, Man City and Spurs have had interest for some time, but not heard that any are in talks right now 
 Further to column re ticket prices, Arsenal point out that those tickets returned by Man City have been reallocated and resold to home fans 
Surprised by that RT @Ian_Ladyman_DM: Vincent Kompany's red card against Arsenal has been overturned by the FA  #mcfc
 HT: Arsenal 0 Swansea 0. Open game, good quality at times, but strangely lacking in intensity. Suspect we'll see Wilshere drop deeper 2nd hf 
FINALLY Arsenal's domination pays off against Swansea. Cazorla and Giroud combine to set up Wilshere for a fierce shot. 87 min 1-0
FT: Arsenal 1 Swansea 0. Arsenal through to face Brighton in 4th round. Astonishing it took Arsenal so long. Wilshere deserved his goal
@janeausten123 Plenty of media at Old Trafford. I switched to Arsenal due to FA event in London this afternoon
 16 min - Chelsea lead Arsenal 2-0 (Mata 6, Lampard pen 16). Very lively start from Chelsea. Wenger has that haunted look again 
 Arsenal 2-0 down. Fans chanting   Spend some f***ing money  . Might help if they convert some f***ing chances and win some f***ing tackles too 
Walcott scores for Arsenal - finally beating the offside trap to score from Cazorla's fine pass. It's now Chelsea 2 Arsenal 1. 58 mins
 FT: Chelsea 2 Arsenal 1. Arsenal stay sixth - six points behind fourth-placed Tottenham, who play Man Utd at 4pm. Chelsea are third 
@ged0407 Indeed. And Brighton v Arsenal definitely should have been. ITV show all-Prem games even when they're not hugely appealing ones ...
A laudable and sensible move RT @JamesOlley: Arsenal have announced ticket prices will be frozen for 2013-14 season.

7 mins - Kroos gives Bayern a 1-0 lead at Arsenal. Powerful right-foot shot from edge of the box
It gets worse for Arsenal. Muller scrambles home rebound following a corner. 2-0 for Bayern
Mandzukic header just wide from Lahm cross as half-time approaches. No Arsenal defender within yards of him. Still 2-0 for Bayern
 Half-time: Arsenal 0 Bayern 2. Boos from crowd followed by a more uplifting   Come on Arsenal  . Bayern so impressive 
@gagsy75 They'd be much better placed in a five-way scramble with Chelsea/Spurs/Arsenal/Everton for 3rd/4th. Top 4? Hard to say
 Frenzied, entertaining start at Spurs-Arsenal. Intensity dropping slightly now, but Adebayor booked for late challenge on Ramsey. 21 min 0-0 
Suspect Wenger will be delighted by the first 25 mins. Arsenal pressing well and passing well. Bale not in the game yet. 0-0
 Barely a minute later and Arsenal defence split again in identical style, Parker setting up Lennon to make it 2-0 for Spurs. 
Arsenal pull a goal back five minutes into the second half. Mertesacker header from Walcott free kick. 2-1 for Spurs. Game on
 Six minutes stoppage time at White Hart Lane, where Spurs lead Arsenal 2-1. 
 Full-time: Spurs 2 Arsenal 1. Huge noise at White Hart Lane. Spurs are now 7 pts clear of Arsenal, who are 5 pts off 4th (Chelsea) 
Wenger will say Arsenal played well but defence was caught out 2x in quick succession. All true. Next question: why does it happen so often?
@DickinsonTimes And how about a 4.45am start to see if Arsenal can overturn two-goal deficit in Munich?
 Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes making a point of how Arsenal nearly overturned 4-0 deficit v Milan last season.   Only   3-1 down this time 
@philmcnulty @GaryLineker He did. He sat down in Arsenal dug-out next to Bergkamp. It went downhill from there
 RT @OldMenDoRun: @OliverKayTimes no surprise that City don't want any restrictions? --> and no surprise that MUFC, Arsenal, LFC etc do 
 @MrIainAG Arsenal are sensible, yes, but I'd say their owner's motives are about profit. Unlike Swansea, WBA, they have a vested interest 
 Confirmed Everton XI v Arsenal: Howard; Coleman, Jagielka, Distin, Baines; Fellaini, Gibson; Barkley, Pienaar, Mirallas; Anichebe 
 Confirmed Arsenal XI v Everton: Szczesny; Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Wilshere; Walcott, Ramsey, Cazorla; Giroud 
 @sajal_thomas Arsenal actually a 4-1-4-1, as I see it, with Wilshere and Ramsey behind Giroud. So we're both half-right ... 
 Everton upset Arsenal fans (and players) with their physical approach, but much to admire in that performance. Brains as well as brawn. 0-0 
@RowanTony I was saying that they upset Arsenal - as any physical team does - not that it bothered me remotely
That's the way to do it. Arsenal form a guard of honour for #MUFC ... and then take a second-minute lead. Walcott from Rosicky pass
Van Persie equalises with penalty after being brought down by Sagna. Arsenal 1 Man Utd 1 - 43 min. Muted celebration from RVP

That's not to denigrate Mourinho or those title-winning teams at all. Just that he's overstating brilliance of MUFC and Arsenal circa 05/06
@JoeHM1 I've known other Arsenal fans talk of a post-Invincibles slump. Would you not agree?
 Such a good win for #avfc today. Terrible result for Arsenal, but maybe, like bad start 2 yrs ago, it forces Wenger to take the blinkers off 
 Never mind   derisory  . Arsenal's bid for Cabaye strikes me as strange. If there's one thing they don't lack, it's ball-playing midfielders 
 Their famed fragility and lack of cutting edge apart, nothing to worry about for Arsenal so far. Playing some good stuff v Fen. 0-0 25 mins 
 Reshuffle for Arsenal after Koscielny kicked in head/face by Webo. Jenkinson on, Sagna to centre-back. 0-0 34 mins. Noisy. 
 Half-time in Istanbul: Fenerbahce 0 Arsenal 0. Arsenal dominating possession, but yet to show enough guile to break down a resolute defence 
 Arsenal take deserved 1-0 lead v Fenerbahce. Ramsey excellent pass, Walcott's cross turned in at the far post by Gibbs 
 Aaron Ramsey, who has been excellent tonight, makes it 2-0 for Arsenal in Istanbul. Keeper should have saved it but Ramsey deserves his goal 
 Very good 3-0 win for Arsenal in Istanbul. Excellent performance, particularly from the ever-improving Ramsey. Totally outplayed Fenerbahce 
@Rafatolah Wasn't watching it. Reporting on Arsenal game in Istanbul.
 @biffo60 Yes, probably, but concealing cracks has earned Man Utd their last two PL titles. It's a skill. Arsenal have yet to master it 
 Re Flamini rejoining Arsenal, it's a good deal -- he offers cover and certain qualities they lack - but there *has* to be more before Sept 2 
 @MrHarryProcter @NUFCThreatLevel Is that right? After that goal against Arsenal, I don't think he's due another one until October 2019 
I answered a few Qs on Arsenal for @highburyclock ://bit.ly/17oyDlf  (NB interview done when transfer situation seemed a bit calmer ...)
Arsenal drawn with Marseille -- a nice reunion for Mathieu Flamini
Arsenal drawn with Dortmund as well as Marseille
 Napoli in with Arsenal, Dortmund and Marseille. Tricky for Arsenal - and the others of course ... 
 Chelsea's group: Steaua Bucharest, Schalke and Basel. Arsenal looking on with envy ... 
 Arsenal, Chelsea, Celtic Champions League fixtures here. And Dortmund, Napoli, Porto, Milan, Barça, Ajax etc pic.twitter.com/2kmNZIYCks 
 @sinnerdine Hard to say. On paper, yes, but depends how they settle in. Either way, I can't see much between them and Arsenal this season 
@mzk90 I don't think Arsenal are affected this time
 Wenger suggests Arsenal have stronger squad than Spurs. Interesting. Man for man, I'd say Spurs, but hard to predict how quickly they'll gel 
 @orujie I'd be staggered if Ozil was willing to go to a club that isn't in Europe this season. Mind you, I expected him to reject Arsenal 
 Arsenal's £42m deal for Ozil close to completion. Providing no last-minute hitches, that's the most exciting Prem Lge signing of the summer 
 Some suggest Arsenal don't   need   Ozil. I'd say he'ill significantly improve them creatively in a way that eg. Cabaye wouldn't have done 
It's not like Arsenal of 3/4 yrs ago that had v specific deficiencies (that weren't addressed ...). This team needs better quality all round
 @JanuszESPN Unless they're prima donnas with huge egos, which Arsenal's current lot don't seem to be 
 Arsenal statement on the signing of Mesut Ozil ://bit.ly/17FO0cU . Expensive, but such a brilliant, clever player 
 People at Chelsea agree re Lukaku. They wanted to loan out Ba and, ideally, keep Lukaku. But Ba only wanted Arsenal and that deal fell down 
 Highest net spends in @premierleague this summer: Man C, Chelsea, Arsenal, Cardiff, So'ton, Man U, Norwich, Swansea, W Ham, L'pool, Villa 
 @scowy1975 Agree, though it seems situation is improving at certain clubs where that stigma existed, eg Arsenal, Liverpool 
@Devilinthehole @themikeybhoy67  I think I'll be at Arsenal-Napoli that night. Hopefully Milan at home
 That's a very impressive result for Arsenal tonight. Ramsey getting better and better. The less said of Chelsea's performance, the better 
 @AlexFortyNine If Arsenal lost at home to Basel, they'd be lambasted by their own fans. As it is, media will do the job with Chelsea tonight 
 @A_Guy_Called @chomandely If you're an Arsenal fan, buy a few papers today. (a) you'll enjoy them & (b) it will shatter a few misconceptions 
 Higuain out RT @LaurensJulien: Napoli XI v Arsenal: Reina; Mesto, Albiol, Britos, Zuniga; Inler, Behrami; Callejón, Hamsik, Insigne; Pandev 
Wilshere on bench for Arsenal v Napoli: Szczesny; Sagna Mertesacker Koscielny Gibbs; Flamini Arteta; Ramsey Ozil Rosicky; Giroud
 Excellent start for Arsenal v Napoli. After fine work by Giroud, Ramsey's cross converted first-time by Ozil for his first Arsenal goal. 1-0 
2-0 for Arsenal inside 15 mins. Ozil sets up Giroud this time
Goal. Yacob header from the excellent Amalfitano's cross. WBA 1 Arsenal 0
 Wilshere, having a poor afternoon to that point, has equalised for Arsenal with a powerful 25-yard shot, deflected in off Olsson. 64min 1-1 
Full time: #WBA 1 Arsenal 1. Arsenal back to top of the table on goals scored. Big cheer from away end when Spurs v WH score flashed up
 Just found myself letting out a Barry Davies-esque gasp of appreciation at Arsenal's first goal. Superb teamwork, improvisation, technique 
 Still early(ish) days, but Arsenal deserve their 5-point lead. By far the most impressive start in terms of performances as well as results 
 Justifiable to doubt Arsenal's staying power, but also justifiable to doubt every other team on the evidence of the season so far 
 @lovemylifelucky @SimonGFear I thought #LFC were ok. Damn sight better than 12 months ago, but Arsenal much stronger 
 @brianespinosa @mickeywestside Jesus. Making point that while people might look for flaws in Arsenal, their rivals have (poss bigger) flaws 
 Notion that Arsenal   can't   win title is bizarre. Not saying they will - clearly big % chance they won't - but certainly strong contenders 
@grumpybluenose Making the point that it's an open field and that Arsenal have as good a chance as any. Not a normal season.
 @JoeBob189 @shargooner Bookies have Arsenal at 7/2. That's 22% chance. Tempting odds, which underestimate them, but they're not a 50/50 shot 
 @grumpybluenose Exactly, hence stating that the widely-held contrary view -- that Arsenal   can't   win it -- is bizarre 
 @ChrisFergy @PoznanInMyPants I   cane   Arsenal???! Read my tweets. Read the paper. This anti-Arsenal press agenda is in your imagination 
@dude_javis What would you say are the chances of Arsenal winning the league? 70/30? 60/40? 50/50? 40/60? 30/70? Higher? Lower?
 @Daniel_Oduro @OsabuANNY What exactly are you taking exception to? Is it something I said/wrote or am I just perceived to be   anti-Arsenal  ? 
 RT @TimesSport: The Game podcast: when the going gets tough for Arsenal, will they get going? ://bit.ly/1iHGb7c  
 @OsabuANNY @Daniel_Oduro Your point, that I'm disrespectful to Arsenal (or any other team) is an inaccurate one. I'll keep doing what I do 
 Klopp says that Mats Hummels is   97.5 per cent   unlikely to play for Dortmund v Arsenal tomorrow. Wenger-esque precision. 
Confirmed Arsenal XI v Dortmund: Szczesny; Sagna Mertesacker Koscielny Gibbs; Ramsey Arteta; Rosicky Ozil Cazorla; Giroud #AFC #BVB
 A joy to watch Dortmund-Arsenal at the magnificent Westfalenstadion, home of the biggest terrace in… ://instagram.com/p/gYq4hqgtId/  
 Aaron Ramsey strikes again! Arsenal 1-0 up in Dortmund. Against the run of play, but they won't care 
 83 mins gone in Dortmund, where Arsenal lead 1-0. Ramsey with the goal again, but Koscielny and particularly Mertesacker have been superb 
Full-time: Dortmund 0 Arsenal 1. What an outstanding result for Arsenal.
 Wenger calls it a   huge win   for Arsenal. Says his players have shown   huge solidarity   to win a game like this 
 Klopp on Arsenal:   Sometimes it seemed as if they were defending with four legs   
A few thoughts on Dortmund 0 Arsenal 1 ://on.fb.me/LZ4DTw 
 Hodgson says FA in   constant   discussions with Arsenal over Wilshere, who's in England squad but still a doubt for game at #MUFC on Sunday 
 @PaulNgalame Genuinely, I've no idea what you're talking about. I've been more optimistic about Arsenal than most Gooners til past few weeks 
@gregfranksimmo I know. Very hard to do what Arsenal have done since March in particular. Even harder to sustain it for a whole season
Van Persie header gives #MUFC 1-0 lead over Arsenal 27 mins.
 Wenger in post-match press conf says the virus was   no excuse   for Arsenal defeat. Feels the problem was that they were nervous in 1st half 
 Moyes calls #MUFC's victory over Arsenal   another step in the right direction  , but he's   not singing and dancing   about it. 
 @Red_Quadrant @Blackburngeorge @OleGunner @dazzyd001 if Spurs were running Arsenal close with inferior mgr and XI, then it's not a bad claim 
Lovely goal from Jack Wilshere to give Arsenal 1-0 after just 30 seconds against Marseille
Would have thought Arsenal deserve to put feet up after winning 4 out of 5 in that group. Still work to do in Naples but they should be fine
 @PavRR8 That was a tough group too. Rare to go out with 10 points. Unprecedented to go out with 12, as one of Arsenal/Dortmund/Napoli could 
@Pondcrossers You're going to have to give me an example of my unbalanced crisis journalism on Arsenal
@Pondcrossers The pressure on Arsenal to improve (pressure from supporters as well as media) is currently greater than it is at Spurs or Utd
@Pondcrossers I disagree with anyone who calls Arsenal's an average group. Who wrote that?
 @KeithGooner1 This month? No. Last mth? Yes. Should be improving, but they've more points than they or Arsenal had at same stage last season 
 @McLeod_7 I agree. Mind you, Arsenal's experience also shows dangers of not replacing top-class talent 
 Free until 5.30pm: @MattHughesTimes blog on Mourinho's increasingly bewildering under-use of Mata ://bit.ly/1hixVhy  plus Arsenal, Spurs 
 Arsenal have been comfortably the most impressive team in Prem Lge since March. Hard to sustain, but they're showing no sign of slowing down 
 @helloblundell Tempted, unlike most, to see Arsenal as slight favourites in an even field. Ask again in 3 wks and I may have changed my mind 
 20 pages of World Cup in Times today. Lots of Arsenal too: my column, @matthughestimes story on Wenger future, @rorysmithtimes meets Walcott 
Arsenal v Tottenham in the FA Cup 3rd round. Man Utd v Swansea. Blackburn v Man City. Plus other games less appealing to TV companies
Arsenal have taken the lead against Everton. Ozil from close range. 1-0 81 mins
Everton equalise at Arsenal. Wonderfully taken by Deulofeu after good work by Barkley and Oviedo.  1-1 84 mins
 FT: Arsenal 1 Everton 1. Superb 2nd half. Arsenal go five points clear at top. Another very encouraging performance from  #efc, who are 5th 
 Martinez says he   couldn't be happier   with Everton's wk after draw at Arsenal. Again spoke of overcoming   mental block    away to top teams 
 Points comparison after 15 games this season and last: Arsenal +14, #NUFC +12, #LFC +11,  #saintsFC +11 ... #WBA -9, #WHUFC -9, #MUFC -14 
 Arsenal team news for Napoli game tomorrow night: Sagna and Podolski haven't travelled. Same squad as Sunday, says Wenger 
Less anxious for Arsenal than the scoreline in Naples implies. Coming 2nd a blow but they'd have taken that (with 4 wins) when draw was made
 This is a superb game. Not just entertaining but, unlike many Prem Lge thrillers, great quality all over pitch. Man City 3 Arsenal 2 64 mins 
 This underlines that point re #LFC RT @JNorthcroft: PL goals in 2013: Liverpool 79, Man City 75, Chelsea 68, Arsenal 66, Man U 61 
 @Harry2671 I'm saying they've made a huge improvement over the past year, as I've said about Arsenal. Fair enough? 
 @Harry2671 I'll say the same as I say about Arsenal. I don't think it's   hype   to talk about very clear, very impressive improvement 
 @Harry2671 Hull was a bad day at the office. Every team has them. Liverpool, like Arsenal, have had impressively few this season. 
 @Harry2671 Not in late-Dalglish, early-Rodgers period. Talking about improvement from one 12-mth period to next - a favourite Arsenal theme! 
Champions League draw (contd): Arsenal v Bayern. Schalke v Real Madrid. Zenit v Dortmund.
Jack Wilshere charged by FA re gesture during Arsenal's defeat at Man City. FA statement ://bit.ly/1kS5MLQ 
 Arsenal so comfortable in beating Spurs 2-0. Little between those two over past few seasons, but Arsenal look a class above again. 
@DanGire Not entirely sure what you disagree with about my initial tweet. Arsenal do look a class above after neck-and-neck of past few yrs
@jamieshanley @DanGire 7-pt gap last Mar looked more vulnerable and less representative (in my unbiased view) than Arsenal current 8-pt lead
 @jamieshanley @DanGire My point really is that THFC now look very   transition-y   while Arsenal look like a team again. Gap looks about right 
 @Agentblue99 @PascalZidane City more stable but I'd say   despite   is right word in Chelsea case. I prefer stability of Utd and, yes, Arsenal 
 FA contacted Arsenal and Tottenham to   seek observations   re missiles thrown on Saturday. FA   support strongest sanctions, incl life bans   
 Full FA statement here re Walcott, Arsenal, Tottenham ://www.thefa.com/news/the-fa-cup/2014/jan/third-round-arsenal-tottenham-coins-sections-theo-walcott … 
 Walcott out for AT LEAST SIX MONTHS, say Arsenal ://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/theo-walcott-ruled-out-for-six-months … Bad, bad news for him, Arsenal, England. Poor lad 
Injury rules Walcott out of World Cup as well as rest of Arsenal's season. ACL rupture a horrible one to come back from. Poor lad (again)
All looking very comfortable for Arsenal at a cold Villa Park. 2-0 up with 17 mins to go. Can Weimann give #avfc a spark? No one else has.
 Benteke pulls a goal back for Villa from Lowton's cross. His first goal since mid-Sept. Nervous last 15 mins for Arsenal, who lead 2-1 
 E-mail from Arsenal regarding   announcement   and   special media conference   at the Emirates on Monday afternoon. Hmmm ... 
 Good to see backing for & coverage of Coventry fan protest at Arsenal. Their   relocation   to Northampton is a scandal. #ff @theskybluetrust 
 Very pleased Wenger is staying at Arsenal. Questioned his approach often enough down the years, but never doubted he's right man for Arsenal 
 @tomehoban I keep hearing that Arsenal, Liverpool, United, City, Chelsea get the best press. Now it's Spurs? I lose track. 
 Great story re Kallstrom injury but Arsenal signed him as cover and he'll be fit by Mar. For midfield negligence, it's hardly on #MUFC scale 
 It was more a comment on #MUFC's failure to add to a terribly lightweight, easily-improved midfield than Arsenal's signing of Kallstrom. 
@jorianm Haha. I lose track of whether the media are supposedly pro-Chelsea/Arsenal/United/City/Liverpool/Spurs. Seems to depend who's top

 Half-time: Arsenal 0 Man Utd 0. A gripping first five minutes, partly due to mistakes. Shortage of real quality since then. #AFC #MUFC 
Full time: Arsenal 0 Man Utd 0. First 10 mins good. Last 10 mins good. Middle 70 mins not so good. Fair result. #AFC #MUFC
   Playing with character as well as quality   refers to #LFC this season -- not tonight, which I didn't see as I'm at Arsenal.

FA Cup QF draw: Arsenal/Liverpool vs Everton. Brighton/Hull vs Sunderland. Sheff Utd/Forest vs Sheff Wed/Charlton. Man City vs Wigan.
Arsenal lead Liverpool 1-0. Oxlade-Chamberlain scores after #LFC fail to clear from free kick
 Quite feisty so far. Monreal, Flamini, Coutinho, Flanagan all booked already. Podolski bewilderingly not. Arsenal leading 1-0 36 mins 
2-0 for Arsenal early in 2nd half. Podolski.
59 mins: Penalty for Liverpool - Podolski on Suarez. Gerrard scores. Arsenal lead is now 2-1.
 FT: Arsenal 2 Liverpool 1. Arsenal at home to Everton in quarter-final. Strong Liverpool performance, but lacked their usual cutting edge 
@buzzkillgooner You're showing me the light? Why thank you. Must make a pleasant change from tweeting about Pokemon and Arsenal
@DraytonOliver I was very complimentary about Arsenal when they beat and drew with Barca at Emirates. Why would you even suggest otherwise?
 @superal999 I've seen Liverpool - and Chelsea, Man Utd, Arsenal - get results against Barcelona on a few occasions, often by being negative 
 @JoshKSM Pretty much. Just waiting to see whether Arsenal can stop Bayern proving themselves a top, top, top, top team 
Here we are again. Arsenal v Bayern @ Emirates Stadium ://instagram.com/p/km4PbNAtMf/ 
Surprising team news. Yaya Sanogo starts up front for Arsenal against Bayern. Oxlade-Chamberlain also starts.
Arsenal XI v Bayern: Szczesny; Sagna Mertesacker Koscielny Gibbs; Flamini Wilshere; Cazorla Ozil Oxlade-Chamb'lain; Sanogo (Giroud on bench)
Arsenal v Bayern ://instagram.com/p/knCt5aAtJ2/ 
 Bayern look so strong. Kroos, Lahm, Thiago, Martinez, Robben superb tonight. If only Ozil had scored pen, tho. Arsenal flying at that point 
 @Wrighty_8 Ha. When you think about it, it really wasn't a wild statement to make. Spurs had finished 1 point behind Arsenal 2 yrs (1/10) 
 @Wrighty_8 looked anything like a team. Since end of Nov, their record over 15 games is very good (only one point fewer than Arsenal) (4/10) 
 @Wrighty_8 When Arsenal were rebuilding, Spurs got very close to them. Now Arsenal are settled and Spurs rebuilding, so the gap has (5/10) 
 @Wrighty_8 opened up again. I did always predict Arsenal would finish above them this season.   Man for man  , though, that's a strong (6/10) 
 @Wrighty_8 squad, many of whom haven't lived up to expect'ns this season, whereas several Arsenal players have improved considerably (710) 
 @Wrighty_8 Anyway, makes a pleasant change to be accused of underestimating Arsenal. This time last year I found myself getting flak (8/10) 
So it was serious after all. Why on earth was he kept on? RT @Arsenal: .@JackWilshere will be sidelined for around 6 wks with a foot injury
Wigan through to FA Cup semi-final again after 2-1 win at Man City. They'll face Arsenal in the semi. Superb win for Rosler and his players
 Nice-looking FA Cup SF line-up: Arsenal v Wigan; Hull v Sheffield United.
Arsenal now a best-priced 8/15 (via @oddschecker) to win FA Cup 
 Wenger confirms Kieran Gibbs is out of Bayern-Arsenal tmrw. Koscielny is back. Vermaelen at left-back   a good possibility  , says Wenger. 
 Wenger on Arsenal's mission as they look to overturn Bayern's 2-0 lead in Munich tmrw:   It is a… ://instagram.com/p/lXvTlcgtKF/  
 Bendtner (knee), Sanogo (toe) picked up injuries and Miyachi ineligible, so only six subs for Arsenal in Munich tonight 
 @MarkLawrenceafc Yes, Arsenal were playing the best team in Europe. That's the point. 
 @NashGunner Arsenal did ok, but there was and is a difference in class between them and the best team in Europe. Surprised you'd disagree 
 Barça-City similar to Bayern-Arsenal. Decent effort by English team, but it comes down to a gap in quality -- not refereeing decisions 
 In Times today: piece on Wenger's 1,000th game in charge of Arsenal ://thetim.es/1r2arjW  A reign of two halves but still so much to admire 
 Wenger's most recent (I won't call it last) trophy came in match no 497 in charge of Arsenal. Tmrw is match 1,000. Wait nearly over? 
 Four mins gone at Stamford Bridge and Eto'o puts Chelsea 1-0 up with a lovely curling shot. Arsenal far, far, far too open 
Good grief. 2-0 for Chelsea inside seven minutes. Schurrle scores after Rosicky dispossessed in midfield. Disastrous start for Arsenal
 Mad. Least of Arsenal's worries tho RT @RobHarris: Oxlade-Chamberlain told ref:   It was me   ... then Gibbs sent off for no apparent reason. 
 Oscar scores from Torres cross 42 mins. 4-0 for Chelsea. Arsenal sleeping again. A truly wretched 1,000th game in charge for Wenger 
5-0. Oscar shot helped on its way by an unconvincing Szczesny. Chelsea heading for record league win under Mourinho. Arsenal abject. 67 min
 FT: Chelsea 6 Arsenal 0. #CFC biggest win under Mourinho. Equals #AFC biggest defeat (8-2) under Wenger. A very unhappy 1,000th for Wenger. 
 Wenger not doing his post-match press conf after Arsenal's 6-0 defeat. Head of comms:   The bus had to go.  
Has done some separate interviews 
 @DanielHarris Agree on some of that, but   weakness   of that league is overstated. Arsenal declined in 04/05 but were still very strong 
 @piersmorgan And more to the point, Wenger deserves lifelong respect from Arsenal fans. The notion of a #Wengerout campaign is just sad. 
Only time a top-flight team (Football Lge and Prem Lge) has won 14 lge games in a row is Arsenal in 2002 (end of 2001/02 and start of 02/03)
Sunderland 3-0 up v Cardiff who are sinking to bottom of table. Norwich about to drop into bottom 3. #NCFC final 2 games v Chelsea & Arsenal
 @AFSCLondon   Scouse mafia   when Merseyside clubs do well,   Manchester mafia   when it's City/Utd,   London mafia   when it's Arsenal/Chelsea... 
 @tapper_t Not just goals with Suarez either. Performances against Arsenal, Spurs, Everton, Man Utd etc dismiss the   flat-track bully   theory 
 @N19herd You're an Arsenal fan and you   loathe   Arsene Wenger? Right ... 
How @TheTimes reported Arsenal's first FA Cup triumph in 1930. The correspondent seemed more taken with the KING pic.twitter.com/2uWm0MY7O7
Wow. Hull take fourth-minute lead against Arsenal in FA Cup final. James Chester the scorer
Astonishing. 2-0 for Hull inside 9 mins. Curtis Davies. Arsenal defending atrocious again
Superb free kick from Cazorla reduces Arsenal's deficit to 2-1. Only 17 mins gone. Already looking like the best FA Cup final at new Wembley
 Arsenal equalise. Koscielny 71 mins. He's injured in the process. No pain, no gain. 2-2 
3-2 for Arsenal. Aaron Ramsey 108 mins. Lovely finish
 Arsenal have won the FA Cup, beating Hull 3-2 -- their first trophy since 2005. After that shocking start, they more than deserved it.

@mackrobert81 @GazzaTCC ... which is also the reason why it's asking an awful lot of Arsenal to win the Premier/Champions League
 Sagna to L'Equipe:   It’s no longer a secret. I will leave Arsenal for sure.  
Unless anything has changed over past week, he'll join #mcfc 
 @robshepherd5 I like him. On reflection, wonder if maybe Arsenal or Chelsea should have considered him for a similar role 
 Bacary Sagna posts thank-you-and-goodbye message to Arsenal on Instagram ://instagram.com/p/pJrwP9OJUm/  As stated weeks ago, he's joining #mcfc 
Sagna to #MCFC confirmed RT @Arsenal: .@Sagnaofficial has agreed to join Manchester City after his contract with @Arsenal expires
That's a strange one RT @Matt_Law_DT: Arsenal captain Vermaelen agrees Manchester United deal in principle. Fee yet to be agreed  #afc #mufc
 Arsenal confirm the signing of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona.   A fantastic footballer,   says Wenger. Few would dispute that. #afc 
Arsenal statement on the signing of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona ://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/20140710/alexis-sanchez-agrees-to-join-arsenal …
 Nervy 1-0 win to take Arsenal through to group stage, but Besiktas looked very decent over the two legs. Arsenal had *just* too much quality 
 For those who like this kind of thing, Arsenal's pass completion rate fell from 89% in the first half to a mere 66% in the second. 
 @DarrenArsenal1 If they'd done it all the other way round (Alexis arriving tonight), there'd be dancing in the streets of Arsenal tonight... 
I like the Welbeck-Arsenal deal. He should become a better player there. Been played wide too often at #MUFC. £16m looks a good deal for AFC
 Not saying Welbeck is the new Thierry Henry. He really isn't. But he has raw materials, should improve at Arsenal if played through middle 
 In Dortmund, where Wenger confirms there's no Debuchy & Monreal for Arsenal tmw. Chambers should be fit despite slight (unspecified) problem 
Hector Bellerin starts for Arsenal in Dortmund. Has played 26 mins of 1st-team football for Arsenal (in Lge Cup). Chambers on bench
 Even @arsenal Twitter feed admits it's   all Dortmund   here. Thirteen shots to Arsenal's none, but somehow it's still 0-0. 39 mins gone 
1-0 for Dortmund. Immobile just before half-time. Arsenal midfield by-passed again
 That was the performance of Klopp's dreams: tireless, relentless, clever, incisive. Arsenal overwhelmed. Far more 1-sided than 2-0 suggests 
 Dortmund-Arsenal player ratings in @BILD_Sport. They grade them differently. 1 (Immobile) = great, 6 (Ozil) =terriblepic.twitter.com/VpIPPvOELa 
 #MUFC 5 pts from games v Swansea, Sunderland, Burnley, QPR, Leicester.
#LCFC 8 pts from games v Everton, Chelsea, Arsenal, Stoke, Man Utd 
 Nearly didn't go to Arsenal tonight, but glad I did. Good to see Welbeck play like that. Enjoyed Ozil, Cazorla, Alexis, Ox-Chamberlain too 
 @ParkyBhoy And if he did have the odd (rare) game like that for Utd, he was usually on the wing the following week. Arsenal suits him better 
Arsenal were 3-0 down and a man down after 17 mins at Chelsea last season. Much more assured so far today. 0-0
 Mourinho says Courtois injury is   concussion, but nothing special   after Chelsea 2 Arsenal 0 
 @GamblingGunner He generally speaks v wisely (except about Arsenal issues at times). Not sure where he was coming from on this one, though 
@Bwagsports I wasn't at Arsenal. I generally find Wenger-bashing lazy. They were declining. He stopped decline. They're now improving again
 @implex Arsenal, Liverpool, Man City, Man Utd and Spurs should all improve, but they're all underperforming to an alarming degree 
 @CityRaider67 Agree with you. Expect more from United, City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs. All have really disappointed me so far this season 
No complaint from #MUFC regarding the Arsenal fan who threw red wine at their bench on Saturday s://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fvjk47UORFs …
 Wenger says Mikel Arteta's calf injury appears   quite serious   after Arsenal's 2-0 win over Dortmund 
 @_PhilHamilton_ Gervinho can skin anyone. It's when he gets into box that he often* frustrates
(*but nothing like as often as at Arsenal) 
Champions League R16 draw (contd): Schalke v Real Madrid; Shakhtar v Bayern; Arsenal v Monaco; Basel v Porto. That's the draw Wenger wanted
1-0 for #LFC. Coutinho scores just before half-time. Well taken. #LIVARS. Time for Arsenal to wake up
And they have woken up. Arsenal equalise almost instantly through Debuchy. #LFC incapable of winning headers in their own box. 1-1 #LIVARS
 Lengthy stoppage at Anfield for Skrtel head gash. Arsenal fans amusing themselves by serenading Kolo Toure with   You are invincible   #LIVARS 
@JezClein They won't get the same amount of injuries as Arsenal and Man Utd. They never do. And it's not a coincidence.
 @Red_since_85 I thought they were unconvincing in victory against Arsenal, Southampton, Liverpool. So did Van Gaal 
 Interesting to hear Chambers playing midfield for Arsenal at So'ton. If not centre-back, could see him settling there rather than right-back 
 @LiamW_93 @Dan_B94 Think over-riding point is that Arsenal, Everton and L'pool have gone backwards, which is why 37 points gets 4th place 
 @Kid_Kensr I don't get that. Southampton, West Ham and Swansea have improved, yes. But Liverpool? Arsenal? Everton? 
 24 min: Cazorla puts Arsenal 1-0 up at #MCFC. Hard to tell if Kompany fouled Monreal, but it stemmed from him losing possession near halfway 
 HT: Man City 0 Arsenal 1. Say it quietly, but Arsenal defending resolutely and counter-attacking intelligently in a big away game. City poor 
2-0 for Arsenal at #MCFC. Giroud header from Cazorla free kick 66 min
 Full time: Man City 0 Arsenal 2. Many words you could use to compliment Arsenal performance. I'd go for   intelligent  . #MCFC? Lethargic. 
 @MacLeTiss Is he claiming to be a City fan? He supported Utd until recently. Chelsea, Arsenal, Blackburn and Leeds before that. Saints next 
Arsenal 1-0 up inside 2 minutes at Brighton. Well taken by Walcott from Chambers cross.
 24 min: 2-0 for Arsenal at Brighton. Ozil's second goal of the season, set up by Rosicky. Arsenal making this look very easy. 
 Arsenal were coasting at 2-0 (like Chelsea yesterday?) but Brighton are back in the game, O'Grady punishing poor defending. #BHAFC 1 #AFC 2. 
59 min: 3-1 for Arsenal at Brighton. The excellent Rosicky wins the ball back and scores with a lovely volley from Giroud's tee-up
 Full time: Brighton 2 Arsenal 3. Arsenal now the bookies' favourites to win the FA Cup -- followed by Man Utd, Liverpool, West Ham. 
Arsenal are in trouble. Kondogbia's shot deflects in off Mertesacker. 1-0 for Monaco 38 mins
2-0 for Monaco at Arsenal. Berbatov on the counter-attack 53 mins
 Impressed by Monaco, but that was alarmingly poor from Arsenal. You can't blame individual errors when they smack of collective weakness 
 Arsene Wenger on Sky Sports:   It was a horrible night.  
No exaggeration. So poor from Arsenal 
@SpinningPl8tes You think Arsenal will get less criticism for tonight than City did last night???
 No of Champs Lge KO ties won 2011/12 to 2013/14: Chelsea 6, Man Utd 1, Man City 0, Arsenal 0 ://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/europe/article4368039.ece …pic.twitter.com/sXBedl9XmH 
 Arsenal have a genuine #MUFC youth product in their starting XI, though. Big night for Danny Welbeck, a man with a point to prove 
 1-0 for Arsenal at Old Trafford. Monreal with a cool finish after a lovely move involving Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain. 26 mins 
Arsenal worthy winners. Defended & attacked intelligently. Utd did neither. Have barely done either all season. De Gea is carrying this team
Some odd reactions to earlier criticism of #mufc performance. 1st half a step in right direction but 2nd half very poor. Arsenal comfortable
 Monaco v Arsenal. Not sure I share Wenger's apparent optimism, but we'll see ... @ Stade Louis II s://instagram.com/p/0V0_zYgtDB/  
 Why oh why didn't I bet on that? So so obvious what would happen.
Full time: Monaco 0 Arsenal 2 (3-3 on aggregate, Monaco win on away goals) 
 Wenger in post-match press conf:   every season is different  .
For better or worse, they seem eerily similar at Arsenal. 
Interesting from @DuckerTheTimes: Smalling back on Arsenal wanted list this summer. Smalling playing lately as if penny has finally dropped
 At Arsenal's training ground, where Arsene Wenger characterises Chelsea as   very efficient on counter-attacks, very efficient on set-pieces   
 Mourinho responds to Arsenal fans'   boring, boring Chelsea   chants:   Ten years without a title, I think that's boring ...   
@joe_browne Ha. I'm sure Arsenal fans don't think I support Arsenal.
 Excellent from @Knox_Harrington on that   Rodgers out, Rafa in   banner. Applies to   Wenger out   crew at Arsenal too  ://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/liverpool-fc-view-kop-anti-rodgers-9192421 … 
 De Gea coming off injured, Valdes on. Arsenal fans chanting   He's off to Madrid.   No hint of a wave goodbye this time. #MUFC 1-0 74 minss 
Equaliser for Arsenal at Old Trafford. Walcott cross deflected in off Blackett. 82 mins 1-1
 Van Gaal:   The difference between Chelsea & Manchester Utd at the moment is that they can finish a game.   Says City & Arsenal can't either. 
 Good stat in Times: first time since 1981 (2nd time since 1972) that none of Arsenal, Liverpool and Man Utd finished in the league's top two 
Headline team news from Wembley: Walcott starts for Arsenal. Giroud on bench. Given and N'Zogbia start for Villa. #facupfinal
40 mins: 1-0 for Arsenal. Walcott pounces on a loose ball. That had been coming. #FACupFinal
WHAT A GOAL. Alexis Sanchez beats Given with a dipping swerving long-range shot. Arsenal 2-0 up 50 mins #FACupFinal
 62 min: 3-0 for Arsenal at Wembley. Mertesacker header.  Awful defending. Arsenal excellent, Villa wretched 
Nice moment after final whistle at Wembley - a bit of a love-in between Wenger and Arsenal fans. He deserves that affection and always will.
 Petr Cech to Arsenal. For first time in far too long,  Arsenal will have a solid, secure, assured, dependable keeper. Expensive but worth it 
 To clarify, Cech move to Arsenal not yet 100% done, but heading in that direction 
 Decent 1st half. Arsenal good value for 1-0 lead, playing some nice stuff. Oxlade-Chamberlain cracking goal. Mediocre defending at both ends 
 Mourinho says Arsenal   left their philosophy in the dressing room   today. Intended as a barb? Coming from JM, it sounds like a compliment. 
@nearl94 Thanks. No apology needed. I'd say jury still out on Mata at Utd (& Ozil at Arsenal). Both better players than they've shown so far
@rossaaaanderson @sathisbabs I agree. Big Ozil fan. But he still hasn't often influenced games at Arsenal as he can (and I suspect will) do
@terrywaite I'm a northern journalist who lives up north. & no doubt he'd get far more criticism/attention if he played for Chelsea/Arsenal
 @PG_Arsenal I'm guessing it met with your approval, so I'll tell you it was @BenSmithBBC 
 I don't mean the loathsome antics. I mean his all-round aggression, which any team (esp Arsenal) could do with s://twitter.com/TimesSport/status/645732977809469440 … 
@Guunner They're far worse. I loathe his antics. I make that clear in report. But most teams (esp Arsenal) could do with a player like that
@ObiwanKenobinil I didn't defend it. I condemned it. But I said his aggression (not the extreme antics) would benefit most teams esp Arsenal
Confirmed: Diego Costa charged with violent conduct. Gabriel charged. Arsenal and Chelsea charged. FA statement here ://the-fa.com/4ssqP9 
 Surprising. Definitely not   violent   but still surprising RT @MattHughesTimes: #Arsenal win appeal re Gabriel red card. 3-game ban withdrawn 
 Arsenal awful tonight. Lots of possession & shots, but one of the worst   without the ball   performances I've seen from supposedly a top team 
 @g_ellis83 It's either cos I'm a rabid Chelsea-loving, Arsenal hater or cos I was at Arsenal and didn't watch Chelsea. I'll let you decide 
@Jegbie I was at Arsenal. Didn't see Chelsea game. Stop being paranoid
 @Grafollogy They have more individual talent & I'd back Arsenal to win if they played three games again. But as a team, they lack something 
 7 mins: 2-0 already for Arsenal (Sanchez and Ozil). #AFC rampant. Dreadful, dishevelled start from #MUFC. 
 Full-time 3-0. Arsenal battered #MUFC like that (perhaps more so) in 1st half of this fixture last season & lost 2-1. Funny game, football. 
 One of those men-against-boys nights -- except Arsenal aren't a team of kids anymore. As brilliant as Bayern are, Arsenal so poor tonight 
 Wenger admits in press conf Arsenal were   extremely poor defensively   &   not at the races  .
He's right - even taking opposition into account 
 Cool finish from Kane to put Tottenham 1-0 up. Again, Arsenal offside trap not exactly remniscent of Adams and Bould at their peak 
Arsenal (especially Ozil & Sanchez) made it look so so easy tonight. Yet they've made this Champ Lge campaign look so hard. Such an odd team
About to depart for Athens with a faulty laptop and a decrepit back. Arsenal's Champions Lge prospects seem glowingly healthy by comparison
@richdodkin Thanks. I'm not too optimistic for Arsenal either
Damning of Man Utd and Arsenal that they find themselves in this predicament in the Champions Lge. Neither group looked - or looks - tough
@GoonerLiam @LeWookieGooner You're allowed to finish second -- as Arsenal know well. Finishing third in this group would be very very poor
Olympiakos v Arsenal @ Karaiskaki Stadium s://www.instagram.com/p/_FT-0KAtPa/ 
 Half-time in Athens. Arsenal 1-0 up but need another goal. Their hopes lie with Ozil, whose exquisite pass opened up defence for Giroud goal 
 Arsenal played admirably tonight. They really REALLY shouldn't have put themselves in this mess in the first place, but still that was good 
 @stueariss It was a prediction, hiding to nothing, bit of fun. Odds were against Arsenal from MD2. That's what made qualification impressive 
Finally possible to imagine #MCFC in QFs of Champs Lge after relatively kind draw (Kiev). Chelsea v PSG? Tough. Arsenal v Barcelona? Tougher
 Wow. Arsenal 2-0 up against Man City just before half-time. Ozil the provider again, this time for Giroud. Sloppy from #MCFC 
 Seen 12 goals, two excellent games, in two nights: Newcastle 3 Man Utd 3, Liverpool 3 Arsenal 3. Scoreline seemed about right in both cases 
Wenger upbeat in press conference after Arsenal concede late equaliser at Anfield. He also says Sanchez might - might - be back at weekend
 @Draexnael Outplayed them all game?Disagree. Even in Liverpool's best spell (first 20 mins), Arsenal looked dangerous 
 Van Gaal looks at TV in press room, notes that Arsenal are drawing, and suggests #MUFC are still in the title race.   We can do it,   he says 
FA Cup QF draw: Reading v Crystal Palace; Everton v Chelsea; Arsenal/Hull v Watford; Shrewsbury/Man Utd v West Ham
 Perspiration 0 Inspiration 2. Arsenal fans applaud their team's effort. It would be enough against most teams, but not against Messi and co 
 Was easy enough to imagine #THFC and/or #MCFC might drop points tonight. But Arsenal? At home to Swansea, from 1-0 up? That's a shocker 
 Confession: when we first launched this about 10 days ago, I had Arsenal to win it by a point. Oops. A fool's errand, but fun #prempredictor 
50 min: Watford take a 1-0 lead at Arsenal. Igahlo turns sharply to punish Arsenal's slack defending from a throw-in
WHAT A GOAL! Thunderous first-time shot from Guedioura to put Watford 2-0 up at Arsenal. Watford absolutely superb since half-time
Full time: Arsenal 1 Watford 2. Boos from the home fans. Watford fans going berserk. Brilliant win for them. Very well deserved
One win in seven matches for Arsenal. Or four wins in 14 if you prefer. It's becoming quite a disintegration
 @GeorgeNo1Fan I'm sure eg Man City and Arsenal have played more   attractive   football at times this season, but nothing like often enough 
Kolo Toure 35 today. This is my fave Kolo story (re his Arsenal trial) from @johncrossmirror excellent Wenger bookpic.twitter.com/1B6DPuGbQM
@KCMANC Pleasure. Always happy to counter the myth of the anti-City/United/Liverpool/Arsenal/Chelsea/Everton/Spurs/small-clubs media ...
 Would love to see a very old Leicester* fan get the opportunity to do this. 
(*Or Spurs or Arsenal, of course) s://twitter.com/BarclaysFooty/status/718046966848966656 … 
 @Pam_nAshes Ha. In any other year, there would be considerable romance  in a Spurs or even Arsenal title triumph. This year different ... 
@Pam_nAshes Exactly. Totally agree. Also might change Arsenal's ambitions if Tottenham won it. (I'm being facetious now ...)
 @wrightylfc123 I criticised him for it yesterday & previously (Arsenal away). Also criticised Gerrard, Rooney, Walcott & many others for it 
 Wish I could see a happy ending for Wenger at Arsenal, but it just feels they're locked in an unfulfilling cycle  s://twitter.com/martynziegler/status/726318439913103360 … 
 That's not same as blaming Wenger for Arsenal's shortcomings, as some do. It's just a reluctant acknowledgement that things have gone stale 
 Brilliant , brilliant finish from Aguero to put #MCFC 1-0 up ... and now a towering head from Giroud to equalise for Arsenal. 10 mins 1-1 
Next stop: #MCFC coaching staff. Such a good player in his Rangers & #EFC days. Arsenal never quite saw best of him s://twitter.com/DaveHytner/status/732164447687610368 …
 Yes I know he did very well for Arsenal for first few seasons. Just suggesting he was even better at Everton, where he was the main man 
 And similarly, just because he played well at Arsenal doesn't mean that they saw him the best of him 
 In part, think it's the type of player they sign. There might also a   nearly men   mentality. See also Arsenal of recent vintage 
Yes. Same with Arsenal - no new Adams/Vieira/Bergkamp/Henry. But it might above all be collective brittleness. Hard to cure
Exactly. Last season far more rewarding/memorable than this season for Arsenal
 Yes - and in those years there would be no need. But this year, #MUFC or #CPFC v #MCFC. 2013 Arsenal v Wigan. I like the idea 
Ha. There's a little bit of Arsenal in there too ... Thank you
 Full time: Man Utd 2 Crystal Palace 1 (aet). #MUFC first FA Cup since 2004, their 12th overall, equalling Arsenal's record 
 Re Vardy/Arsenal, would love to see #LCFC team stick together, but realistically not going to happen if players offered far more £ elsewhere 
 Yes, but £80,000 a week is Leicester's limit (currently). Arsenal could probably pay him double that. 
 Certainly. A few more than United, I should think -- and certainly far fewer than Arsenal, Chelsea and others 
a) I don't think I have and b) top 4 in PL is a basic target for a club of Arsenal's resources. Iceland in Euros? Brilliant
Really pleased to see Vardy staying at #LCFC. Would be great to see that team stay together. Not convinced he would've suited Arsenal either
 No, won't pipe down. He's been excellent -- and I say that as someone who's frequently underwhelmed by him at Arsenal 
Arsenal v Liverpool. I'm expecting goals. Cue 0-0 bore draw ... @ Emirates Stadium s://www.instagram.com/p/BJFw1Y-gpam/ 
 Feels (more than ever) like the mood around Arsenal/Wenger will turn to fervent optimism or furious despair, depending on today's result 
 .... And then Walcott makes up for it, low shot into the far corner. 1-0 for Arsenal 
3-1 for #LFC now. Coutinho again. Arsenal are being picked apart
 Arsenal opening PL game in recent seasons
10/11 draw
11/12 draw
12/13 draw
13/14 lose
14/15 win
15/16 lose
16/17 looking like another defeat 
Wenger getting an earful (to put it mildly) from some of the Arsenal fans near the dug-out. Stewards getting involved. Not pretty. #LFC 4-2
 Press conf, Wenger puts Arsenal defeat down to:
1) Psychological blow of #LFC equaliser
2)   Physically we're not ready yet  
3) Inexperience 
 For those asking, yes of course Wenger was asked why Arsenal are   not ready   yet. He cited the Euros, injuries, usual early-season rustiness 
... which is what a lot of Arsenal fans are praying Wenger will do ... .
 Looks like it was done by an Arsenal fan. One with a better sense of humour than you, presumably 
Can you give an example of how press are harsh/disrespectful to Arsenal -- and how this compares to fanbase?
And I don't think for a moment that retweeting an Arsenal fan's joke about Ramsey's haircut is disrespectful
 Wrote about it in Saturday's Times. Essentially, yes the market is utterly ludicrous, but Arsenal *have* to invest 
Leicester in the same group as Porto. Arsenal in the same group as Paris St Germain
Spurs 2-0 down now v Monaco. Lemar this time. Awful defending. The Wembley experience seems to be taking on an Arsenal-late-90s feel
 Watford have had really tough fixtures: Soton & West Ham away, Chelsea, Arsenal and Man Utd at home). 7 pts an impressive start for Mazzarri 
 Very true. FWIW, the one defeat in 91 was at Chelsea. Sounding like an Arsenal fan now. I'm not. Just a nerd ... 
 Thanks v much. He has me tearing my hair out at times, but he's one of best things to happen to English football & Arsenal 
BBC inviting you to pick your Arsenal team from Wenger's 20 years. Here's mine ://bbc.in/2cDYe6O  Not much love for the past decade ...
 I wrote that Utd have played a game fewer than City & Arsenal. (As have Liverpool, as you said, but I was writing about Utd) 
 Graham also said it was his Arsenal, not #MUFC, who   knocked Liverpool off their perch  . (@Carra23 & others argue LFC knocked th/selves off) 
 By   when they were getting battered  , do you mean the  games they lost v Liverpool & Arsenal? That's a bit different, I'd say. 
 Re @johncrossmirror excellent Wenger book, I would also recommend the new updated edition of   Arsenal: The Making of a Modern Superclub   pic.twitter.com/eAZcqhSlT8 
And Arsenal face Bayern Munich again. Not the greatest reward for winning their group ...
 #LFC goalkeeping troubles reminiscent of Arsenal pre-Cech and #MUFC pre-Van der Sar. Need a commanding, consistent, assured No 1 
 Interesting that this table is dominated by players from #MCFC, Chelsea, Arsenal. Until recently, it would have been full of #MUFC playerss://twitter.com/OliverKayTimes/status/809679691141496832 … 
Cech has attempted more passes than any Arsenal player so far. Red ones unsuccessful. Strange approach from Arsenal today (via @StatsZone)pic.twitter.com/s6PE7IqCJR
 Huge improvement from #MCFC in 2nd half - energy, creativity, spirit - but they haven't totally overwhelmed Arsenal. They haven't had to.

Arsenal v Burnley @ ArsenalFC s://www.instagram.com/p/BPkd6B4jczi/ 
 Well, that had been coming. Mustafi header from Ozil corner. Arsenal lead 1-0, 59 mins 
 Unfortunately for Arsenal, the Xhaka/Scholes comparisons end there 
 Thanks Jane.Probably not a popular opinion on   Arsenal Twitter   today .... 
Can assure you Arsenal are far too sensible a club to give or withdraw respect based on an opinion of an open-and-shut case
 media, just as you would rightly laugh at the suggestion of an anti-Utd/Arsenal/Chelsea/Liverpool/Spurs media-> 
Today's column on Liverpool and parallels with post-Invincibles Arsenal: so much style but not enough substance ://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/liverpool-are-stylish-but-a-soft-touch-pcjr8jtv3?shareToken=899487220e48d08798f49ff3e6e49d51 … #LFC

 There's more to football than running about, but this stat seems rather damning of Arsenal's recent efforts s://twitter.com/OliverKayTimes/status/828872870705168384 …pic.twitter.com/RvhJ0Z6fUN 
 And Arsenal have had some truly, truly great ones over the Wenger era. But no player has given the club as much as Wenger has 
 Having said all of that, Arsenal seem locked in an infuriating cycle under Wenger - as summed up by this @TimesSport graphicpic.twitter.com/vjTQZTJiNH 
 Neuer also said he heard from England that   the experts are saying Arsenal is a top contender for Premier Lge title  . Not sure about that... 
 Last Arsenal team to win a Champs Lge knockout tie included Almunia, Bendtner (hat-trick!), Nasri, Arshavin and a 35-year-old Sol Campbell s://twitter.com/TimesSport/status/831656103268212737 … 
Bayern v Arsenal teamsheet pic.twitter.com/vR5KehFnSK
 Some very impressive stuff from Bayern tonight but that was a wet-paper-bag performance from Arsenal. Abysmal, spineless showing in 2nd half 
 Arsenal didn't seem to know how to play when not in possession. Given that they barely had the ball all night, that was quite a big problem 
 Wenger saying on BT Sport that Arsenal   mentally collapsed  .
Yes they did, Arsene. Not just mentally but tactically & physically too. Feeble 
 Ancelotti said European champions need   courage  . Arsenal showed none last night. Ozil, sadly, particularly culpable ://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/oezil-offers-masterclass-in-mental-fragility-q6lqhvzz9?shareToken=4d34719734d98e97645522f8e0e1167b … 
 Genuine answer. Spurs' record this season is worse, but Arsenal have more resources, higher standards, more experience --> 
 which is why mood around Arsenal (not just media -- fans more so) is so -ve, whereas Spurs happy just to be in CL (briefly) 
Big difference between selling best players (which so frustrated Arsenal fans) & getting good money for deadwood Chelsea-style
 On Wenger and why the   safe option   is no longer viable if Arsenal are serious about breaking an unfulfilling cycle
://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/if-wenger-hasnt-fixed-it-now-he-never-will-0qbth9q6q?shareToken=45ca9b91b0c435e1ce1db2ea36f7d2cd … 
 I don't think the word   unfulfilling   is either hysterical or inaccurate. Are Arsenal's players/fans fulfilled? Is Wenger? No. 
 Sorry. That was actually @SolManOfficial on Arsenal - & Wenger needing to   bust a gut   if, as Sol expects, he stays ://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/wenger-must-buy-winners-at-any-cost-5nv3kk3wx?shareToken=784095d9e6a42b137abf85b0a7f6e202 … 
Is that assessment based on what you know of his coaching/leadership skills or simply fact he left Spurs for Arsenal in 2001?
 Sad to see this. Think Arsenal need a fresh start, but treating Wenger like this is just wrong. s://twitter.com/MrDtAFC/status/839182102864277505 … 
Exactly. That is a club having the life sucked out of it by an incompetent who doesn't care. Arsenal is none of those things
Arsenal sold all their best players over the next six years. Was that Wenger's fault?
   Oh, hang on. Arsenal lost to Bayern again. This puts Wenger on a par with SISU, Venkys, Duchatelet, Bechetti etc   
 And with Arsenal, there is no demise whatsoever. Only mild stagnation. So yes, totally different scenario 
 Started off by saying I think Arsenal need change. But Wenger deserves respect, esp from Arsenal fans 
 No, you dimwit. The point is those clubs are being killed by incompetents. Arsenal are merely being held back -- slightly. 
 For the past 5+ years, Bayern have far, far, far outperformed all PL teams -- including those richer than Arsenal 
 .@johncrossmirror reporting that Wenger has decided that ... he wants to stay. Wrong move for him and Arsenal, I fear. 
 Probably the same way you outrun them when you have 61%, as Man City did against Arsenal 
Of course. Does surprises me that you'd be instinctively dismissive of stats that suggest Arsenal aren't working hard at present
 Whatever it is that worries Arsenal's board about Life After Wenger, the alternative is far more terrifying. New deal would be huge mistake 
Correct
Arsenal can't afford to be scared by #MUFC post-Ferguson struggle. Decline has begun under Wenger. Change essentials://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/arsenal-wont-crumble-like-united-when-ferguson-left-tl99668wf?shareToken=3dce586da3d9c274ed6b0a48205e927f …
Not talking about progress against rivals. Talking about measuring own progress. You say Arsenal progressed 2014-16. Let's agree to disagree
Even @Arsenal twitter suggesting so s://twitter.com/Arsenal/status/854031729727852544 …
Arsenal leading City 1-0 while Dicko runs 2.2 in 3.13?
2-1 for Arsenal. Sanchez from close range
 Full time at Wembley: Arsenal 2 Manchester City 1 (AET). Arsenal through to the FA Cup final. Well, well, well ... 
 City were wrongly denied a goal yesterday. Arsenal were wrongly, in opinion of many observers, denied a penalty. That's truth 
 Wenger says there's no   power shift   between Arsenal and Spurs because   you can't say that one year has the weight of 20  . Yeah, but ... pic.twitter.com/lW1ea1oDO8 
Just pointing out that this season isn't some wild blip. It's largely reflective of a trend that Arsenal must reverse
 Exactly. Was predicted to be a four-horse race between Chelsea, Arsenal, City, United. Ended up a three-horse race 
 Exactly. To me the ultimate spectacle is Guardiola-era Barcelona. But unlike the   Barca Lite   years (of Cesc etc), Arsenal nowhere near that 
 I've enjoyed it more too, but it's still less enjoyable - as a neutral - than eg Arsenal's, which is far from great 
 I don't think Arsenal are significantly better or worse than last season. On the whole, they've stood still while others slightly improved 
 Brilliant FA Cup win for Arsenal. So pleased for Wenger, who deserves it more than anyone, esp after ridiculous abuse he's been subjected to 

Highly unusual website statement by #Arsenal on #Fabregas. Still has to leave for sake of career.
 Sunday colleagues off on safari to see the   Big Five   tmrw. They think they're going to see United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs. 
 @jloskaterjim72 woud be an amazing signing, Pires was a great player at #Arsenal, #Wenger let him go too soon. 
 Best/worst kit so far in pre-season? Still time to change #spurs away, dreadful. nice touch with red detail on cuffs #arsenal home. 
 BBC piling on pressure asking for predictions. Any thoughts, other than 1st ref to Fergie Time, Arsenal   tika-taka football   or Mancini OBE? 
 Ray Parlour convinced Schwarzer is happening, wouldn't disagree. #arsenal.

 Great to see Wilshere playing for #Arsenal today, deserves his chance, talented enough to outshine Joe Cole. #liverpool 
 Shocking decision to send off Joe Cole for that, not that kind of player. This should be one of games of season. #liverpool #arsenal 
 Arsene Wenger, buy a goalkeeper. #arsenal #liverpool 
@sunstevebrenner wenger's been trying to turn into a non-contact sport for years. And each year they never win the league. #arsenal

Wilshere looking so much quicker for #arsenal this season. Over-exuberant challenge on Zigic a result of him running the game.
 Blow for Arsenal and Arsene Wenger, boy from Brazil Wellington Silva denied work permit today. 
 For those asking about Wellington Silva home office have work permit department, Arsenal told earlier today he doesn't meet criteria.

@neilashton_notw ha... Arsenal and Everton legend.
 @berkeracar at peak of powers he was magic for arsenal, your   idiot mate   is on to something. For longevity Giggs wins. Ability Pires. 
 Have finally found someone who isn't watching Arsenal v Barcelona. Ever the pro, Mark Hughes at Bolton v Wigan ahead of FAC tie Sunday. 
 Wilshere unfazed, best player on the pitch for Arsenal. Walcott will be dragged at half time if he keeps this up. 
 Appreciate dialogue, esp re Walcott. Most sent before he was subbed and before Arsenal scored twice. 
 Koscielny outstanding for Arsenal, he probably didn't realise he was capable of playing like that. 
 Love all the predictable   official score CL score   responses. Btw not   anti-Arsenal  , nor   anti-Walcott  . Great night for both. 
@danielnotaro arsenal have been successful over a long period of time. Put your rivalry to one side for 5 mins.

 @rdm_bwfc major questions. Arsenal money men happy to qualify for CL to pay for stadium, no pressure to win trophies 
 @sawyer_arsenal no, I'm serious. Bendtner won't be intimidated by reputations, others will. 
Arsenal fan on LBC phone-in wants Wenger out... and Owen Coyle in.
 @NorthGooner why is it unnecessary to say arsenal are 8/9 players short of title team if i believe it to be true? re cesc, what sarcasm? 
Looking forward to talking about Arsenal on talkSPORT with Goldstein and Cundy from 115pm
@Sawyer_Arsenal Palace
 @DarrenArsenal1 don't get me started on arsenal, not tonight 
 @JsMills sorry, i was under impression arsenal would dominate chat, i don't set talksport agenda 
at least wilshere gave it a go today. how many arsenal players can stand side by side with him after that performance.
@mollymaxdad ha ha... one thing you would never see me wear is an arsenal shirt pal
 @YankeeGunner they don't have a single player on £100,000 a week. arsenal full of them when bonuses take into account 
 @Arsenalman2011 arsenal are seasoned CL campaigners, but they're not good enough when it comes to barcelona. 
@cjelcapitan best football? i don't agree with that creation any more. i'd go to united and spurs ahead of arsenal now
 @Arsenalman2011 anti-arsenal... sorry, you take it too personally because i said they are 8/9 players away from a PL title. 
@Arsenal_Away about the same.
 @Arsenal_Away   my mate   
 Thanks to all the Arsenal fans for driving the Harry Redknapp out debate overnight. Hope Spurs fans who feel the same have sobered up, too. 
@Sawyer_Arsenal because i told them they're not good enough to win the title with that team. journalist isn't a beauty pageant
 @Arsenal_Away i love in London, but there we are 
 @Arsenal_Away in the past yes, but not any more 
 @Sawyer_Arsenal no, i don't. i don't see emmanuel eboue, squillaci, koscielny, walcott, bendtner etc with title winning medals in same team 
 @Arsenal_Away wenger changed the culture of players at arsenal from a combination of physical, mental and skill to just skill and wit. 
 @TheArsenaleye i'm judging redknapp in isolation from arsenal, you're not 
 @TheArsenaleye i'm judging redknapp in isolation, not comparing him with arsenal but his club, time there, the players, the salary   cap   
 @Arsenal_Away that's right mate, I'm still hoping to get a game for them 
 @Arsenal_Away when they get a stadium they will have a chance, until then forget it.   My mate redknapp  ... 
Arsenal still 2/3 players short according to Arsene Wenger's apologists. Going to stick with 8 or 9.
 @Arsenal_Away   my mate  ? If you knew the history between us you'd think differently. 
 @TheBoyClem thanks pal, you're in a small field of people to say that! Arsenal fans upset again today. 
 @kingstonbear it's the power of the message from the manager and board, fans fall for it, arsenal a classic example 
@DanielNotaro my point is that arsenal will never win a significant trophy again under current recruitment policy.
 @DanielNotaro seriously, with exception of ronnie gaucho teams almost equal in 06. What happened to arsenal over next five years? 
 Manchester United, Arsenal and Samir Nasri. Online column: ://bit.ly/kNvJVd 
@RichardCann76 clubs have spoken about Nasri. Arsenal indicated they will not sell until Wenger signs replacements.
 @Gee28Mufc if Arsenal sell now, Nasri+Fabregas cash is £65m. Other clubs will put premium on Arsenal targets. 
@zamMUFC19 arsenal don't want to sell to united but what's the alternative if he runs down his contract?
@zamMUFC19 ashley young is on 135k a week at United. They'll pay nasri more and win more trophies than Arsenal.
 @Alisalmanh they have discussed nasri with arsenal but if they sell now, clubs will put premium on arsenal targets. 
 @whereswalters1 I don't see that, arsenal want to reconfigure their squad first. 
 @StephenBusby88 why's that fella, united have had dialogue with arsenal. 
 @StephenBusby88 ha, that's funny. Arsenal told them to wait, they want to find replacements before anything can happen. 
 Heading into talkSPORT, 8pm-10pm with Sam Matterface. United, City, Arsenal... 
 @avoidconfusion Ferguson is desperate to get him, always tough to buy from a rival club but it can happen if arsenal find replacements 
 @Miles_Aarhus various theories, but arsenal told united they want time to find replacements before deciding on nasri 
 @GlenGraham2 he wants out of arsenal. tough to call, but fergie made it clear to board last week he wanted nasri. 
 @grahambanks i like him, his best performance was CLSF v Arsenal but then bombed v Barca in 09 final. 
 @Superman041 they've been in contact, arsenal taking their time, united abit more pressing 
 @holly100789 they don't want to obviously, but arsenal bought silvestre a couple of years back so why not? 
@trixt_uk why not? united sold silvestre to arsenal
 @Superman041 no, I never said that. I said United would bid, they have spoken to Arsenal, and Arsenal told them to wait. 
 @Superman041 don't know about player/wenger, but up top clubs have spoken. Arsenal want replacements. Alternative is convince him to stay 
 @rattaz79 is it that straightforward? Arsenal have to believe their squad will improve by signing players to replace him, which isn't easy 
 Gervinho one of the signings of the summer. Great value, top quality and will make an instant impact at Arsenal. 
 @mufcwp clubs have spoken about nasri, arsenal want to wait. 
 @Jonnyarsenal what was that mate, what did I say, something nice about arsenal...? 
 @mufcwp depends what constitutes a bid, but the conversation with arsenal has taken place. 
 @Toombster when arsenal recruit more players is my suspicion, then they will take a view 
 @Jonnyarsenal compare 2006 barca team and arsenal, not much in it. 5 years on... 
 @Johnny_C91 he's desperate to go, as his website address to arsenal fans at start of last season made clear. So let him go. 
@gpf1983 Palace. The Arsenal of South London.
 @joemufcbowman yes, it is, but arsenal told united to be patient as they want replacements before they'd consider selling 
Talking about the great Patrick Vieira on FiveLive just after 730pm. Should make supporters of Arsenal and Manchester City happy...
Looking forward to speaking with the legendary @johncrossmirror live from Arsenal's pre-season tour on talkSPORT at 330pm.
 @Arsenalman2011 not my fault arsenal can't win a trophy pal, that's down to the manager. 
 ASHTON | talkSPORT from 3pm-5pm with Ian Danter. All the big issues, including Gervinho - the signing of the summer for Arsenal. 
 @MickTheGooner signing contract protects both parties. He's been at arsenal for 8yrs, that's half a career. Get rid and move on 
 @MickTheGooner I don't agree with his pre-season attitude but mostly has given his all, so don't see why arsenal holding out. £30m. 
@MattWigley my only argument against is that arsenal will make a profit on him regardless of fee.
 @Jimmisav andy carroll isn't worth £30m. Arsenal should sell and move on, it's shocking the club's captain is not involved at EC this w/e 
 @MickTheGooner I think arsenal should repay fabregas loyalty, which has been almost unequivocal for 8ys. 
 @MickTheGooner the point being is that he's done his time, just let him go. £30m is almost £30m more than arsenal paid for him. 
 @Hesfivefootfour according to board arsenal already have the money, quibbling with barca over £5m will lose you a title not win it. 
 @Silts81 arsenal want £35m, why do fans think he's worth £60m then. 
 @Silts81 for club captain his attitude is scandalous, I don't understand why arsenal fans so willingly accept this behaviour. 
 @Silts81 ideally you'd get more, but this disruption and sideshow will affect arsenal's season. 
 @GomezGooner sorry, lots of other arsenal fans getting upset now, what was it? 
Apologies. Diaby not Song. Worryingly I was at Newcastle 4 Arsenal 4 as well.
 @Sawyer_Arsenal come on, give me a chance 
Watch your team for a tenner. Brilliant Football League initiative in today's Sun. Nice contrast to £100 top price ticket at Arsenal.
@HarlowGooner no problem at all. The point being is the most expensive tickets in PL are at Arsenal and cost £100.
 @HarlowGooner just making a point about price differential. Arsenal fans a little over sensitive at the moment, perhaps for good reason. 
 @Arsenal_Away er, no I didn't. 
 @Arsenal_Away I don't need to deny something I never said. Alan said he was on holiday. I know it was early, but wakey wakey. 
 @ibby_dj at the risk of upsetting a few arsenal fans again, I think they're willing to sell now. 
@Arsenal_Away shame you reach that conclusion simply because I don't share your belief in a manager's philosophy.
@Arsenal_Away if one of them made me an offer I'd be able to tell you.
 @paulcoog you think fabregas wanted to go to barca because the media brainwashed him? No, it's because he can't win trophies at arsenal 
 @Cfcaway wish I'd been there, but it clashed with arsenal and had to go there instead... 
GLOBAL GAME | AL JAZEERA SPORT +3 | 8pm | Martin Keown with me in the studio to discuss Arsenal and the other Champions League qualifiers.
 Is there a goodbye message for Sami from Arsenal fans before he signs a £220,000 a week contract? 
@timothysansom in Wenger's mind he doesn't have any failings. To my mind The Project is over and sadly so is his time as Arsenal manager.
 Some good news for Arsenal fans, Santos work permit agreed. 
 Already looking forward to an airing of   Arteta for England   after a couple of half-decent matches for Arsenal... 
@Sawyer_Arsenal in Dougie we trust.
 @bluwhit heading into talkSPORT at 10pm for the final knockings. Arsenal's approach today is desperation measures, the end of The Project. 
 Panic over, Arsenal's long-term future is secure. Arsenal's U10s beat Chelsea U10s 11-0 today in an academy match, 20mins each way. 
@Arsenal_Away you're hard to please.
 @Arsenal_Away great idea, although it always seemed to upset arsenal fans for some reason. 
 @Arsenal_Away seriously I don't agree with the blind faith, that's all! 
 @Joeslovebus ha, you should have come to say hello. Must admit I was aware of a few looks, but I was with Arsenal supporting friends 
 @Arsenal_Away sorry, forgot how well things have been going over the past 5 years 
 @Arsenal_Away I respect the club and its achievements, I've never believed Wenger's post 05 philosophy will lead to trophies 
 @Arsenal_Away not really sure what your point is, I've been trying to do that for a decade. 
 @DanielSlavin I referenced Steven Howard's column in the Sun today, then said Arsenal won't win trophies with current philosophy. 
 @Arsenal_Away it could have been avoided, but he broke up a successful team too early and brought in meek replacements 
 @Asyd_rrein ha, I need to ask arsenal fans for immunity for one night as I'm sitting with them for the olympiakos game. 
 @Arsenal_Away he will have to get his allegations through lawyers etc, don't think that will be easy, but he says he has the documents. 
 @Arsenal_Away realistically done what I wanted, which was to find an agent who walked away from the game. TV his next step apparently 
 @Arsenal_Away yes mate, they all granted me immunity and were very kind to me. 
 @mcfclaura I'm a traditionalist, I'm sticking with Hyde United... Bit like Woolwich Arsenal etc 
@Sawyer_Arsenal did you lose again yesterday or is this just a courtesy call?
 @TerrenceTheCat losing like that to arsenal - at home - was a one off, I'm sure of it. 
 @Arsenal_Away @berbafaz hey, I was here before AVB. 
@Arsenal_Away I don't think my resources stretch to Armani Collection. Btw I'm older - maybe he's copying me??
 Heading to Arsenal to beat @johncrossmirror to tweet the   official attendance   and inevitable mention that this is   tough test for #afc  . 
 @Arsenal_Away incredible performance, the result is for the four guys who bought the club. 
 Tickets available for Emirates Stadium Tour, hosted by Arsenal legends Charlie George, Kenny Sansom and @johncrossmirror 
 Rare public appearance by @johncrossmirror at The Cock in Islington from 7pm tonight, signing copies of a new Arsenal book. 
 @Keefism I can't go in with the fans at arsenal any more, they think I hate the club... Yawn. But it would be good to do that for sure. 
Special #ff @johncrossmirror who will be cutting the red ribbons on Arsenal statue unveiling at 2pm today.
 @stonydaz @johncrossmirror easy darren, john does a lot of positive PR work for arsenal and the beauty is they don't even have to pay him 
@vishakharsenal I remember being devastated when he nearly signed for arsenal in 1980 - mercifully he stayed on a bit longer.
 RT @johncrossmirror: Please remember the #afc Arsenal Fans Forum has moved to MONDAYS. Join me and Tom Watt. Ring in, lots to discuss. 
 @KenSansom3 ken you have inadvertently put an arsenal badge in your profile pic, can you change it back to Palace please. #schoolboyerror 
#ff @johncrossmirror he's at Arsenal training watching Arsenal players coached by Arsenal mgr AW ready for Arsenal's next #bigtest. #afc
@johncrossmirror have you left the Arsenal training ground yet? #afc #robin #theo #drench
Is @johncrossmirror more excited about Father Christmas or Theirry Henry coming back to Arsenal? Web column. #theo #robin #drench
 @Lampett88 I'm sure his professionalism will rub off. His final year at Arsenal not his finest hour, though. 
 @DONeill83 there are two things certain in life. Death, and @johncrossmirror legging up arsenal players 
Scanned copy of Arsenal teamsheet up for grabs to anyone who can guess subject of @johncrossmirror's first new year column #afc
@johncrossmirror isn't that the number of people actually attending most Arsenal home games?
 George Graham on LBC:   arsenal finishing fourth this season would be weng's greatest achievement...   
 Hugely dignified and honourable, GG also said   wenger best manager in arsenal's history  . 
 @Reillypatr he's good, but not good enough for arsenal. Like most of the players. 
@johncrossmirror how annoyed are you - i can't spot an Arsenal connection on the pitch anywhere.
 Ashamed to admit I thought Arsenal were only 6 or 7 players short last season. On reflection, it's a whole squad. 
 @bladered arsenal are finished under current philosophy, been saying it for 5 years pal. 
 @jaygor1 look at results since 2007, arsenal are out of the game. 
Arsenal fans may want Wenger to leave but these players are his signings. Defy anyone to improve results with such an average group.
 @Brett_leverton they are good, but not good enough for arsenal Brett - that is the simple test. Irrelevant whether they get in bolton team. 
 @rishi_sidhu ramsey, walcott etc are squad players at a club with arsenal's history. They need quality, plus regrettably a new manager 
 @W3104_ come on, please... Don't fall into that trap. Under Wenger's current philosophy Arsenal will never compete for top trophies 
 @Pigeon1873 wage cap?? Henry was earning 130k a week when he left, arsenal wages over 100m a year 
 @Howley_1 funny you say that, my friends are arsenal fans pre-premier league and they want dignified exit. #getyourfactsstraight 
 @Arsenal_Away didn't see that, where was it? 
 @Arsenal_Away I dont tolerate abuse, pretty straightforward really. It's tough enough dealing with humans, let alone a cat. 
 @Arsenal_Away no, no. #lifeban 
 @Howley_1 can't get too excited about song, Walcott or Ramsey I'm afraid; average for a club of arsenal's ambition 
 RVP says   massive dream   to win PFA poty. Thanks Arsenal -   massive club with great people, from Akers to Wenger, this is for him.   
 @AdamArsenal would love a return to days when fans had season ticket for spurs/arsenal, city/united. 
 @superbarsenal what are arsenal fans celebrating tonight, are they handing out trophies for finishing third? 
 @mariappanm yes, of winning the title - only a few players good enough at Arsenal to go the distance and win a PL. 
 RT: @premierleague:   I want to get us back to the level of the Invincibles.   - Wenger on Arsenal's 20 seasons best team. 
 @DanPowellAFC no, but I don't believe arsenal will win major trophies under current recruitment policy. Good players are not good enough. 
 @BuzDunworth I meant that it was a tap-in to give arsenal a cuff over the invincibles, which is why I ignored the temptation 
 @Arsenal_Away thanks, enjoyed seeing Capello for a couple of hours. I'm with Sharapova when it comes to twitter at this moment. 
 Can understand why official attendance at Wembley is claimed to be 70,584: they have borrowed Arsenal's stadium announcer. #60,000 
@officialabs1 funny! Like the time I wrote he would quit Arsenal and he issued a statement to say he wasn't. #nextstopmancity
 @Arsenal_Away iPad, handy to have in case I need to look something up in a break. Hope you enjoyed show. 
@Arsenal_Away what is your considered judgement on Arsenal at this moment?
 @Super_G_ thanks - arsenal chat is part two, would be good to hear your views. 
 @Arsenal_Away city, united, Chels, arsenal. Suspect Liverpool and tottenham have too many problems to threaten 
@NHC1989 it's not anti-arsenal.
 @Arsenal_Away I'm doing it this Sunday, but Brian will be back hopefully the following week. 
@EastUpper3 maybe they should have sold him to arsenal when they had the chance.
 @Cjipps hmmm as things stand... City/united. Chelsea, Arsenal. Tottenham. Everton. Spurs will change manager if they really have to. 
 @NFFC_PAUL london colney, arsenal's training ground 
 @Arsenal_Away thanks, where do you stand on the debate? 
 @Arsenal_Away why does everyone think that!? I admire Wenger, but his philosophy is honourable but flawed. Liv result good. 
 @Arsenal_Away benitez won CL, plus bt chel and man u home+away season they should have won it. 
@Arsenal_Away lovely turn of phrase ;
 @Arsenal_Away none taken, made me laugh 
 Great to see @johncrossmirror at an Arsenal press conference this morning, just like old times. Delighted to report nothing has changed. 
Pretty sure Arsenal's supporters heard Ivan Gazidis say all this last year... And the year before...
 Are Arsenal fans right to criticise Kroenke, Gazidis, Wenger? Sportsmail's top team give their view in tmrw's edition/online from 11pm. 
@martinjfiler problem for arsenal is that he has more ability on the ball than Walcott or ox-chamberlain
 Back on talksport right now... @johncrossmirror. Talking Arsenal, I think 
Arsenal fans have every right to demand answers to that question about Ivan Gazidis.
@BlairStripOne arsenal are a high profile london club with fantastic history and pedigree - easy to negotiate commercial deals.
 @NeilPayne I agree with that, but the media adore him. He's a nice, incredibly charming man - but he's been at Arsenal too long. 
@NeilPayne I've been pretty isolated on the subject - I said in 07 arsenal will never win a major trophy under current recruitment policy.
 @Always__Arsenal no, out and out winger, ronaldinho-type. 
 @Always__Arsenal no, he plays like ronaldinho. I think he drifts across front three eventually 
 @PavRR8 got rid of Ronnie, brought in messi iniesta and xavi as regulars! All three on bench in 2006 UCL final v arsenal 
@MuppetGooner at any other club of arsenal's standing the manager would have been sacked after 7 years without silverware
 Mail Online column: Finish fourth and everyone at Arsenal is paid out, except the fans. ://tinyurl.com/cda8bsr  
 Morning... Arsenal chat first up on the @SundaySupp with @OllieHolt22, Jason Burt and David Woods on SS1 from 930am. 
 @bluwhit impossible to see beyond may, but he would get in arsenal team ahead of AOC and Walcott. 
 Morning... Mark Hughes chat first on @SundaySupp from 930 with @DickinsonTimes, @Matt_Law_SM and @sbates_people. Chelsea, Arsenal, AVB... 
Just the one wish left in life: can Arsenal and Theo Walcott spare us all by ending this contract saga.
 @Famlan as long as Arsene keeps Arsenal in the top four everyone gets paid, including his £7m a year salary, that's why. 
 @Super_G_ I'm afraid I've been saying it for years. Nice guy, finished at Arsenal. 
@Super_G_ people are talking about Walcott being your saviour by offering him 100k a week. Mid-table player. Arsenal way behind.
 @garthyboy1 a sad night in your house that you can't enjoy a win at arsenal, absolutely incredible. 
 Morning...first up on the @sundaysupp, we're talking Arsenal with Martin Samuel, @_PaulHayward and Paul Smith from 930 on SS1. 
 @terrybyfield @mikesinnerton bit presumptious, although I would expect us to beat arsenal away the way we're playing... ;-) 
@WorldCupRio it's a myth that arsenal don't spent big on wages. They paid henry 130k a week in 2006 and gave him £5m one-off just to stay.
Guest column on the Arsenal illusion for the top men at @WhoScored: ://www.whoscored.com/Blog/ptuwehp1zemsqtixkbu1xq/Show/Team-Focus-Arsenal#.ULyz4ciApSg.twitter …
 @Swinestar96 good enough for Arsenal, but not nearly good enough to win a title. 
 Patrick Barclay, Jason Burt and @johncrossmirror are on the @sundaysupp 930am SS1. Warning: Crossy may mention Arsenal at some point. 
 No grounds for complaint. United won trophies during OT redevelopment, Arsenal can't use Emirates as an excuse: ://bit.ly/UhFyFz  
@hul10 how many trophies have they won at Arsenal?
 Fellaini first up on @sundaysupp, followed by Chelsea CWC, QPR, Liverpool, Villa, Norwich and Wilshere/Arsenal from 930 SS1HD. 
 @rubsluton yes, but arsenal didnt sign him from scratch, that was the point being made. He was someone else's potential 
Errrrrr have just had sight of the media list for Reading-v-Arsenal and @johncrossmirror isn't on it. Is this a mistake?
 @Arsenal_Away no, not vindicated at all. Remember I thought Gervinho would be decent, turned out otherwise. Your thoughts on AW? 
 @Arsenal_Away then everyone goes on holiday and has a fresh start, same as every season. 
Shame @johncrossmirror couldn't make it for Arsenal's emphatic win at Reading. The future...?
The balls are in the pots already. Macca and Kluivert preparing to pull out Arsenal and Barca in rehearsal. More on Mail Online.
Arsenal-v-Juventus. CL draw rehearsal!! Don't get too excited just yet.
 Arsenal v Bayern 19 feb, return leg in Allianz arena 13 March 
@hul10 arsenal are the fifth biggest club in UCL. When was his last major trophy?
@kevsat1 he's a wanted man but united and arsenal in no rush for a number of reasons
To Arsenal's daybreak press conference. Will an excitable @johncrossmirror be serving bacon butties?
@samstewart_11 levy's always been ruthless. Arsenal's deals are put together by email by a bloke in Dallas.
 Arteta misses out for Arsenal today with a calf strain, picked it up in training yesterday. Diaby returns - but for how long? 
 @JohnStapletonTV will do. Have you seen old man lately, even he didn't go to Arsenal game. 
Arsenal being overwhelmed here.
@DBPalace did mos say he was signing for arsenal 100pc?
 @Paul_Lake hi mate, what are you doing with old man? ask him about the tickets i got for him arsenal v man city, that will entertain you 
 If the Feb onlinegooner referendum is an accurate reflection of Arsenal fans, 82.91pc want a new manager (no stats on how many voted). 
 @GaryG86 I want arsenal to win on Tuesday, but if they get beaten badly then I fear the worst from fans now. 
@JayWilliamsJay @thearsenal_ I didn't ask him about it. Arsenal had already gone on record earlier to say the story was not true.
 @BenGranville yes, in many ways I sympathise. Press conference set up at Arsenal for newspapers is a bun-fight. Ridiculous position for AW. 
 @drewnealgrove the point is the discipline of the regime. Bayern are methodical, Arsenal's training isn't. Get over it. 
 @1paulivey Clive joined palace, he had only been at arsenal for about two weeks, 
 No trophies again for Arsenal, but Aaron Ramsey should get an award for most improved player. 
RVP on the United table at PFA awards. Wish Arsenal fans had shown their appreciation for his long service today.

 @NatashaSHenry you do realise it is Chelsea playing up there, not arsenal?? 
 @Arsenes_Glasses haha, arsenal chat in part four... 
 @BhavikDepala what did I say that was   anti-arsenal   today...? 
 The moment AVB said   Arsenal are in a downward spiral   after north London derby at WHL has come back to haunt him today. 
 @Gooner_66 he had outgrown Arsenal, but his attitude in 06/07 was appalling. 
@burnsieboy65 I loved that man. My first Palace hero. When Daily Mail wrote he was going to Arsenal I said I was going with him.
 @RossH1983 haha, normally he's upsetting arsenal fans. ;-) 
Quincy Owusu-Abeyie scores a sweet goal... See what you're missing Arsenal fans.
 @QueenofSuburbia ha... Come on, I'm just looking out for the Arsenal fans.

 Wenger on Chelsea substitute Ashley Cole, would you bring him back to Arsenal in the summer?   If I needed a left back, yes  . 
At Arsenal v Palace: match report will be live on Mailonline at the final whistle.
Arsenal are up and running. Match report from the Emirates: ://dailym.ai/1mUVBHG 
 Quite a night for Calum Chambers, he has been Arsenal's best player in their opening two competitive matches. 
To the Arsenal.
Yet another set piece that Arsenal's defence fails to deal with adequately for Clyne's goal. What do they do all week.
 Absolute minimum requirement in an Arsenal shirt is 100% effort, irrespective of the competition. Arsenal fans didn't see that tonight.

Not another Arsenal injury surely… Welbeck limps along the touchline and straight to the dressing room with an England physio.

Giroud has been outstanding for Arsenal in the first half. Towering performance.
 Player ratings from City-v-Arsenal are coming soon to @mailsport, so feel free to get stuck in. 
 Wenger pretty gracious about the penalty. Accepts that on reflection, he has been told Arsenal were fortunate. 
 @goonerlaird no, but i wasn't wearing an Arsenal shirt either. 
 Looking forward to watching Ozil and Walcott for Arsenal this afternoon, should they start.

i'm on the fans' forum show on arsenal tv with tom watt at 8pm. should be good
Major title for Arsenal? Gunners fan Ian Poulter leading the Masters
Off to Emirates for fans forum on Arsenal TV online with Tom Watt. Defence surely the big talking point tonight.
Good Arsenal TV fans' forum - lots of complaints about Almunia but also lots of faith for the rest of the Premier League season.
 Arsenal fan Ian Poulter must be taking fashion advice from Nick Bendtner - forget pink boots, it's all about pink sun visors in golf! 
 Arsenal fans, don't worry about the Cesc Fabregas-Manchester City story. If he does leave in the summer it will be to return to Spain. 
kranjcar to have scan tomorrow on leg injury suffered against pompey - could be out of arsenal game
Great weekend for Chelsea and Arsenal. The Gunners will really fancy taking advantage of Tottenham's tired legs at WHL.
Could RVP be the difference for Arsenal? Wenger thinks so
gael clichy thinks the tott v arsenal match could be the biggest n london derby of recent times - draw no good for either side
Usmanov may not publicly rule out an attempted takeover of Arsenal but he knows any offer he made would be rejected. Kroenke still the man
What now for Arsenal? Lots of questions ahead of next season. Gallas? Sol? Cesc? And Wenger will be holding contract talks in the summer
Denilson probably out of Wigan game - the Arsenal injuries just keep on coming.
wenger today hinted sol may get new #arsenal contract thanks to spurs display
good luck to @johncrossmirror on #arsenal fans forum tonight. well worth a watch if you're in
spoke to #tottenham employee who said he'd take three points from arsenal #chelsea and #mufc games - could be six points with #mufc to come
#football maybe wenger has a point about the premier league being far better than la liga. #arsenal will still think they have a chance.
 sunday rumours - #arsenal want rodallega, joe hart, rob green and will offer wenger contract to 2014 - thoughts? lyon want eduardo for 8mill 
reports in spain that #arsenal midfielder fran merida has agreed deal with atletico madrid. think that was the case some time ago
also #arsenal boss wenger practically confirms chamakh is on his way. can't see another striker coming in but vela could go
no doubt my pal and arsenal expert @johncrossmirror will be singing martin o'neill's praises later...
 most people would be more likely to compare us to bill and ben, however!!! #arsenal updates coming later 
@DanCompton Would be amazed in #mcfc agreed to sell Hart to #arsenal. Sczhesney will be a great keeper - but got to give him time
 Would #arsenal fans out there prefer Hart, Green or Almunia? Would be amazed if #mcfc agreed to sell Hart to rivals 
Popular opinion is #Arsenal need to replace Almunia. Hart is getting a good shout
@AnmolC I may be wrong but think Steve Mandanda once had a trial for #avfc and was rejected. In that case not good enough for #arsenal
@Batze14 Wenger was asked about Lloris last week. He hinted he would be too expensive for #arsenal
@Yebs I may as well be up front about this #avfc born and bred but lived in London for eight years and have strong affection for #arsenal
@RasDam #Arsenal sold two players who City were prepared to pay silly money for and who were on the way down. Hart is on the way up.
@AnmolC Arsenal got good young keepers - they need someone to come straight into first team.
@benthear That's the big problem - #mcfc would be mad to sell to #arsenal.
Latest #arsenal kid to come through is 18-year-old Conor henderson who is thought to be on bench at Wigan today.
#Arsenal kid Conor Henderson - central midfielder or wide left. Played for both England and Eire youth teams
@Yebs Good Villa Park knowledge! Great to get an idea of #arsenal views and opinions
Fabianski in goal for #arsenal at Wigan today - very interesting after Wenger hinted he may be after a new keeper during the summer
What do #Arsenal fans think of Fabianski in goal today? End of the road for Almunia?
 #arsenal: Fabianski, Sagna, Campbell, Silvestre, Clichy, Walcott, Eastmond, Diaby, Nasri, Rosicky, Bendtner. Henderson and VP on bench 
No Almunia on bench for #arsenal. Mannone
I'd like to see Clichy as #arsenal deputy captain behind Cesc. Strikes me as a real leader. Pleased for Sol though.
These purple nike boots are very popular at the moment. #Arsenal not comfortable at the back at the mo.
@Arsenal_Blog No idea - Black addidas are the way forward
#Arsenal turning the screw - would be a great time to score
Get in Theo - kew he'd have a good day today. So pleased for him. #Arsenal 1 up
 A lot of people disagree with me on Theo. Keep the faith, with fitness and confidence he will be a big big players for #Arsenal and #England 
How many points have goalkeepers cost #Arsenal this season? This is ridiculous. Fab not to blame for N'Zogbia strike
I tried to give Fabianski the benefit of the doubt - but can't defend him after that. So so sloppy from #Arsenal
There can now be no debate - #Arsenal must sign a goalkeeper. Fact
Paul Merson: #Arsenal will never ever win another League title until they get a goalkeeper
what do #arsenal fans want? beat #mcfc and help #tottenham or #mcfc win to harm spurs cl hopes?
good attitude from #arsenal fans - want to beat #mcfc and forget #tottenham. good to hear
@aphiss #avfc born and bred but strong affection for #arsenal and report on them for daily express
spoke to pl keeper coach today who said #arsenal's fabianski just not good enough...
also said #arsenal have too many young keepers so none of them play enough....
@darrenepsein1 remember arsenal were never in the title race last season and all the top teams have dropped more points this term
@darrenepstein1 remember arsenal were never in the title race last season and all the top teams have dropped more points this term
Understand #arsenal anger but Wenger going is not the answer. Apart from new players what about changes in backroom staff to freshen things?
my friend @dtguardian says #arsenal fans could be charged up to 73pounds for a ticket next season
sorry missed out key fact - @dtguardian says #arsenal fans could be charged up to 73 pounds for a ticket at #chelsea next season
it seems it's #chelsea fans to be charged up to 73pounds for #arsenal game. trying to establish what away fans will pay next season...
 okay, panic over. @dtguardian is taking great delight i have misunderstood. #chelsea home fans paying up to 73 pounds next season 4 #arsenal 
@CraianosGoon could be truth there is interest but would be amazed if #mcfc sold to #arsenal
 Ian Wright makes some valid #arsenal points. But Eduardo? I assume he wasn't at the Wolves game . Sorry, but Eduardo not the answer. 
 It will be fascinating to see how Jose Mourinho tries to stop Messi. #Arsenal couldn't cope, so let's see how special the Special One is. 
@Roscoewigley9 I take your point but Arsenal could have done more to cut off supply to Messi - watch what Mourinho does about Xavi
Barca have not bid for clichy but the idea of selling him has not been dismissed by everyone at #arsenal...
Lots of different views on clichy. I think #arsenal should keep him. One of few experienced natrul leaders in squad. Gibbs needs more time
Wenger still undecided on keeper for #arsenal game against #mcfc. Would like to give fab another go before end of season
Arshavin thinks he will be fit for #arsenal game against #mcfc - still no word on keepers
@AnmolC Interesting day I said! It was the fact not everyone inside #arsenal is against selling clichy and the fact #westham could go ...
AW says Almunia still has a wrist problem so Fabianski is set to keep his place in goal for #arsenal against #mcfc this weekend.
Seeing Arsene Wenger today. Should be a lot to talk about ahead of #arsenal v #mcfc - not least a certain former striker...
 @lovenotkate I'll do my best - there will be a lot of chat about former #arsenal players, goalkeepers and transfers today 
Lots of good words about Ledley from #spurs and #arsenal fans but majority seem to think he would be too much of a risk for World Cup.
Okay next question before I set off for London Colney shortly. Will #spurs fans be cheering for #arsenal this weekend?
#ff all #arsenal and #spurs fans should be following @DTguardian today for all the latest opposition news
An #arsenal round-up ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/170960/Arsene-Wenger-s-battle-plan/
Big contrast on how #arsenal manager Wenger spoke about Vieira and Adebayor today. Giving little away re keepers and transfers
@KARLITO_SW Many thanks for shout. I cover #arsenal and have London affection for them. But must be clear I am a Villa fan born and bred!
Wenger refused to talk at all about #arsenal transfers today - but interestingly ruled nothing out
#celtic confirmed for #arsenal emirates cup - #acmilan rumoured
So who are these 'experts' advising #arsenal boss wenger on keepers?
@mungobungo Very tight but # arsenal to nick it
Turns out that giggs bloke can take a pen then - massive game for #mcfc at #arsenal now
 #arsenal - fab in, vp starts and capt, adebayor on bench. full teams to come 
 #arsenal team v #mcfc - Fabianski, Sagna, Campbell, Silvestre, Clichy, Rosicky, Song, Diaby, Walcott, Van Persie (capt), Nasri 
 #mcfc team v #arsenal - Given, Zabaleta, Toure (capt), Kompany, Bridge, Johnson, Barry, Vieira, De Jong, Bellamy, Tevez 
#mcfc - Adbebayor on the bench v #arsenal. Vieira and Toure start
Ade laughs and claps when booed by #arsenal fans. Press box have a laugh at Ade's pig-tails. Nice of him to sport a comedy haircut today.
Someone has a banner tha reads 'vote Eboue on May 6' at the Emirates. Probably a better bet than the rest #arsenal
#arsenal on top at the mo - #mcfc surprisingly negative with only Tevez as an out-and-out striker
Given hurt after saving Diaby shot - arsenal fans take the break as a chance to let adebayor know what they think of him #adebayorboo
Gunnar Nielsen a Faroe Islands international. I suggest #arsenal should shoot a lot now
Given applauded by #arsenal crowd - nice touch
0-0 - #arsenal had the better of it but lacked a cutting edge. #mcfc disappointing and may regret not being more positive from the start
 Piers Morgan: #Arsenal should sign Torres, Gerrard and Shay Given. Glad to see he lives in the real world then. Idiot. 
Arsene Wenger has supposedly told a dutch magazine that he 'finally has the money to buy what he needs' for arsenal...
@DoronSalomon Exactly and I'm sure #arsenal would have liked an emergency loan when all their strikers were injured. #mcfc have a keeper.
 Actually, I'm sure lots of #arsenal fans would have liked an emergency loan for a keeper because they don't seem to rate any of theirs! 
Off to speak to an 'expert' about #arsenal goalkeepers this afternoon. Anything in particular #arsenal fans would like to know?
#Arsenal will have looked at several keepers but one that has been scouted is AZ Alkmaar's Argentine Sergio Romero - would cost about £5mill
Can't say too much about #arsenal keeper chat but lots more praise for Szczesny and interesting insight into Almunia and Fabianksi...
 Arsenal confirm Emirates Cup on July 31 and Sunday August 1. Celtic, AC Milan and Lyon complete the line-up. 
#arsenal interested in #blackburn defender phil jones. #arsenal goalkeeper piece in tomorrow's express
#Arsenal keepers: ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/football/view/172122/Bob-hope-for-Arsenal-goalkeepers
#arsenal press conference later this afternoon. Arsene Wenger should be interesting on all the transfer rumours and Arshavin's comments
AW has cast doubt on Eduardo's #arsenal future by saying he will talk to him before the end of the season.
#Arsenal boss AW also angry about Arshavin saying playing for Barcelona would be the pinnacle of his career.
AW confirms #arsenal will confirm a signing before the World Cup. I'm thinking Chamakh
lots of #arsenal fans want more than the three signings aw is saying he will make at max
not too much grief at the possibility of eduardo leaving #arsenal in the summer
interesting #arsenal william gallas news coming much later...
#arsenal face competition for #blackburn defender Phil Jones. #chelsea #mufc #mcfc #liverpool #tottenham and #aston villa all looking too.
#Arsenal boss AW: Gallas must make contract decision by the end of May or we will look for a replacement. More talks planned. Deadline set
The press office at #arsenal is excellent. But #arsenal website story of Arshavin correcting his position re Barca is way off the mark.
#arsenal should stop arshavin spouting off if they are unhappy instead of inventing excuses for him
...as i said though the #arsenal press office are generally excellent and wenger is always a delight to interview
arshavin has his say again - criticises #arsenal medical dept and the club food
arshavin makes some valid points but not sure #arsenal or wenger will be pleased he's gone public again
how many of #arsenal's line up today are good enough for a title push?
 in my humble #arsenal need a keeper, two centre backs, a midfielder and striker - that's five. wenger thinks three 
 #arsenal players who should start first game of next season: vermaelen, gallas if stays, gibbs, cesc, song, walcott, van persie, maybe arsh 
diaby can be great but doesn't provide drive for #arsenal on consistent basis
maybe a small clue on what wenger is thinking on #arsenal keepers. szczesny offered to champ clubs on loan for next season
 So Chamakh confirms the news we already knew for about the past year - he's coming to #Arsenal. Also, Wenger hints he may buy from the PL 
#arsenal round-up: ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/173464/Arsenal-move-for-Marouane-Chamakh
 Almunia still out for #arsenal, so it's either Fabianski or Mannone against #fulham... 
wenger cancels #arsenal press conference after losing his voice. No wenger opinion on #tottenham then...
Wenger may have no voice but remains bullish about the job he's doing at #arsenal
wenger says #arsenal fans should celebrate finishing in top four like #tottenham did
wenger also warns champs league football should not be taken for granted at #arsenal
heard a rumour henri lansbury could be on the #arsenal bench today after completing #watford loan. should know in an hour or so...
lansbury and djourou on bench for #arsenal
as expected #fulham rest all their big hitters against #arsenal today
#arsenal striker robin van persie says #tottenham have to prove themselves over longer period
despite interest and rumours still no firm suggestion fabregas will actually leave #arsenal this summer
Gallas linked to #Tottenham but really can't see it. #Arsenal pay better than Spurs and he would not be assured of 1st-team football at WHL
#arsenal fans won't like the papers tomorrow - fairly serious cesc fabregas news. He's definitely considering his future
We've known cesc and barca like each other for a while. But this is first real te we know he is unsure whether to stay at #arsenal.
Report in spain that #arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas will have meeting on future with Wenger on Tuesday. I'm told no meeting planned as yet
 Just read a blog saying the media hate #arsenal. Nonsense, arsenal treat us brilliantly and they generally get a great press. 
#Barcelona now publicly up the stakes in bid for #arsenal's Fabregas. You may all collectively yawn but nervous wait to discover resolution.
Cesc also very keen to avoid saga as he has too much respect for #arsenal so I don't think he will leave everybody hanging for too long...
 @timothydclark Tough question, it is up in the air. I wouldn't put money either way on cesc. But that in itself is worrying for #arsenal. 
#Arsenal want £40m for Cesc: ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/176022/Arsenal-to-demand-40m-for-Cesc-Fabregas
Why #Arsenal should grant Cesc his dream: ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/175999/Arsenal-s-Cesc-Fabregas-wants-to-swap-shirts
Barca will not do themselves any favours if they keep talking about #arsenal midfielder Fabregas - they should shut up and do the deal.
Barcelona admit contact with #arsenal on Fabregas but say no official bid. They also say they do not know how long the transfer will take
@RussJefferys Alright mate good to hear from u. Arsenal and Barca are at least £10mill apart which is a big old gap. How are wedding plans?
Cesc's dad says he must be allowed to leave #arsenal asap - this is starting to look like a carefully-orchestrated campaign...
No shock Cesc was respectful in his comments about Arsenal - never any danger of him 'doing and adebayor'
#Arsenal striker Van Persie scored twice against Mexico last night - I have a real feeling he could be one of the stars of the World Cup
Can't see Joe Cole to #arsenal myself but Wenger does like him as a player. He's not what they need in any case
I'm told barca have tried to 'talk' to #Arsenal about cesc twice but have not actually made a bid. #Arsenal should report them now.
@creidy44 There is interest in Cole from #arsenal but I think #tottenham will make a stronger move for him. Wenger is def a fan of Cole
Barca official bid in for Fabregas. I'm told it's still far too low for #Arsenal's liking. Expect this to rumble on
 #arsenal reject barca bid around 30mill but i fear this is the start, rather than the beginning of the saga... 
To #arsenal fans who ask. An enquiry has been made for Joe Cole but club won't offer him more than the £80k a week he's on at #chelsea
Joe Cole released by #chelsea but I really wouldn't expect him to sign for #arsenal. #Tottenham are the club in for him strongest at the mo
#arsenal sign koscielny. Chamakh already done and schwarzer to come. Can't see those three signings changing an awful lot
Not saying #Arsenal's signings aren't good just can't see koscielny being that much better than gallas or chamakh scoring 20 goals.
@quincyjjohnson basically said winning the world cup was for all his arsenal team-mates and staff who have helped him over the years
@schatuk said that winning the world cup was for his arsenal team-mates and staff who have helped him over the years
@OleGunner said winning the World Cup was for his arsenal team-mates and staff who have helped him over the years.
 @thefaults Interesting points, many of which I agree with. However, I still think arsenal need to cope better against phsyical opponents. 
@lovenotkate I write about arsenal but am a Villa fan. Wenger's whinging gets on my nerves but I do think they should get more protection.
The Cesc pics of him being forced into a Barca shirt don't look great  but he is clearly uncomfortable. Hope #Arsenal fans don't turn on him
Arsenal #ff @johncrossmirror and @darrenarsenal1
Arsenal really encouraged they can win their Cesc battle after Rosell's latest comments - see tomorrow's Express for full story....
@thefaults He's very goodand he's a keeper Arsenal have watched before. Schwarzer still top target.
 @christopherEvo no worries - i'm simply reporting arsenal are encouraged, which they are! 
Wenger wants cesc talk to stop - not sure it will but arsenal confident he stays
A lot of sympathy around for the fact Eduardo has not fulfilled his potential at Arsenal. Move to Shak would be best for both parties now
 Arsenal would only give Joe Cole 80k and two-year deal, Spurs £65k three years and big signing on, Liverpool 90k four years. Says it all. 
Arsenal confirm Clock End returns from the start of this season with a new clock.
at the mo eduardo not due to go to austria cause arsenal expect him to sign for shakhtar
told the correct pic of arsenal striker eduardo is now on website. i might even link the story shortly!
@pauljmason My job is to write about arsenal and I like to think I know what's going on. I'm a Villa fan - don't report on them.
Arsenal now ban vuvuzelas - so that's Tottenaham and Arsenal. How many PL clubs by the end of the week?
overwhelming opinion so far is that wilshere should not be loaned out by arsenal and should get a chance
Arsenal fans don't panic yet - much of what El mundo Deportivo is reporting is speculation about what Barca WANT to happen re Cesc
Blow for arsenal if sol goes to newcastle. They thought they had him
Chamakh scores for arsenal - first of many this season?
Fabregas to face #arsenal fans ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/189672/Cesc-Fabregas-braced-to-face-the-Arsenal-fans
@pjbish no you don't speak for all arsenal fans actually.
@JonnyCarroll1 No - Schwarzer wants Arsenal and Arsenal want him - could help move it along
@rosscoarsenal I think Arsenal photcall is next Thursday
I would like to stress @DarrenArsenal1 is a very good mind of Arsenal info. I was told photocall is next Thursday - same day as members' day
Arsenal out of hat - in Group H
Shakhtar Donetsk in Group H...with Arsenal. Weng will take that
Arsenal have best group of English teams so far. Spurs need to avoid G and A
As pointed out by @rosscoarsenal Arsenal v Shakhtar means reunion with Eduardo
Braga (looked good against Sevilla) in Group H with Arsenal and Shakhtar. Wenger will still be pleased though
 Arsenal, Braga Shakhtar. Man United, Valencia, Rangers. Spurs, Bremen, Inter Milan. Chelsea, Marseille Sparktak Moscow. 
 FK Partizan (Belgrade) in Group H. Gorup H Arsenal, Shakhtar, Braga and Partizan. 
 @Maniscream Should have followed me - did live updates. Spurs with Inter Milan, Bremen and Twente. Easy for Arsenal. Chels in with Marseille 
Watch for West Ham and Spurs in this transfer window deadline day. Arsenal to get Schwarzer.
@JamieDalton82 still think arsenal will get schwarzer done. Just. Fulham have more targets than just given
Arsenal to confirm theo injury this arvo - his people know nothing of him being out six weeks
 Confirmed: theo thinks he'll be out 4 weeks, arsenal cautious and saying 6. Sprain a bit worse than orginally thought 
 Off to see Arsene in a couple of hours - feels a bit like Groundhog Day with striker injuries. New season, same old Arsenal... 
 Read an article from 1932 by Mrs David Jack, wife of Arsenal's record £10k signing from Bolton. WAG life sounds a bit different back then! 
Arsene enlightening as ever. Good stuff on Jack WIlshere and the Arsenal keeper debate. Sorry can't link it until tomorrow morning.
Wenger says he will not feel sorry for any player playing for arsenal - says almunia will deal with it
Clichy. Diaby rested for arsenal. Gibbs plays
 Arsenal: almunia, eboue, koscielny, squillaci, gibbs, fabregas, song, wilshere, rosicky, chamakh, arshavin 
A sheep scores arsenal's 1000th pl goal under wenger. Double baa
Good win for arsenal but a better team may have caused them probs. Jury out on new defence.
I take the point that Arsenal rested defenders today but I am not convinced by Koscielny - how good was Fabregas though? He can never leave
@TheGoonerholic Can't see Diaby playing v Braga - hard to know how to stop the fouls on Arsenal players when they move the ball so quickly
 @OneDanPowell 'you lot' Who's that then? Press? If you mean Arsenal fans, then I support Villa. This is not an Arsenal story... 
@DoronSalomon Wenger saying it doesn't have to be. You might disagree but interesting debate and it's not just about Arsenal
@AndyElche Thanks Andy - should be some decent Arsenal pieces in tomorrow's newspapers.
 Spurs press conf to preview Arsenal game this morning. Arsenal not doing one - Spurs or no Spurs, Wenger not bothered about the Carling Cup 
Do Spurs and Arsenal fans care too much aboit tomorrow's derby? Both managers could both do without it...
 In my mini poll Arsenal fans don;t seem to be too bothered about tomorrow night, Spurs supporters strangely quiet... 
Just been at Spurs - they will field weakened side but those at the club still really want to put one over Arsenal. Even in Carling Cup
@DarrenArsenal1 Gallas won't be playing - Tottenham to rest as many as Arsenal
@roxym2kThat's unfair - @johncrossmirror is an excellent reporter and has definitely never made anything up. Nobody better on Arsenal.
Quality - Wierd Twitter black out. Wenger in the White Hart Lane stands tongiht but Harry might get a shock when he sees the Arsenal team...
Some members of press room shocked by strength of arsenal team
First thing Wenger did in p conf was dedicate Spurs win to Jack Chester. He helped Arsenal raise funds for Teenage Cancer Trust but died.
Kieran Gibbs' foot not broken - relief for Arsenal who last night seemed pretty sure it was
Anyone watching arsenal fans forum show tonight ring in and ask @johncrossmirror why he's not wearing his pink shirt
Diaby and eboue in for arsenal today. Wilshere on the bench
Get the feeling arsenal thought this would be easy. So far it isn't
Arsenal still in this but almunia has had a total 'mare.
No Arsenal player would speak after today's defeat. No leaders on the pitch today and none off it. Harsh but true.
@rosscoarsenal Cesc wasn't on the pitch. Today Arsenal had no leaders on the pitch and nobody who played was prepared to stand up aftewards
@Jhomsie What about your stadn-in captain or any number of the internationals in the team. It's poor and un-Arsenal-like
I would like to point out the Arsenal press office did try to convince a player to talk. This was a player silence and not a club silence
@vdjumpah That's because I don't cover Manchester United and I expect better of Arsenal
 Lampard out for 2 more weeks - misses Arsenal game and England game. With Milner suspended, gives Capello a dilemma 
 Gignac off for Marseille - hasn't looked very good, no wonder Arsenal decided against him. Good decision. 
Arsenal fans watch goal 4 - we were doing it a long time before you!!!! ://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1dM49e7Dz4
@IanJamesPoulter Will you wear anything to show your support for Arsenal against on final day of singles? Lucky socks?
I've heard a whisper that @matt_barlow_dm is doing the Arsenal fans forum tonight. Try to get him to show his black and orange adidas. Ace
 Ian poulter 'I will deliver a point'. Very confident, hope he's more reliable than his football team. #rydercup #arsenal 
I accept responsibility for jinxing Westwood today. The #Arsenal fans who can't take some gentle ribbing should lighten up.
 Stuart Pearce will want Jack Wilshere at the Euro Under-21s, just as he did Theo. Arsenal don't want him to play for Under-21s and seniors 
 #Arsenal Koscielny out, Cesc not fit but Bendtner and Theo back. Vermaelen still no nearer and Van Perise could be another four weeks. 
 Expected Arsenal line-up tomorrow: Fabianksi, Eboue, Djourou, Squillaci, Clichy, Song, Wilshere, Nasri, Rosicky, Arshavin, Chamakh 
Worst journey to arsenal. Ever.
Cesc is full training for arsenal today - pires turned up late but still allowed to train with rest of squad
Eduardo says he won't celebrate if he scores v arsenal #havemystoriesforfree
If you're already a couple of goals up would #arsenal fans stand to applaud an eduardo goal tonight?
@aindie2009 arsenal to win 3-1 - hope eduardo scores
Good of sky to use the audio of me asking eduardo if he would celebrate v arsenal. Thanks sky
Cesc starts for arsenal v shakhtar. Eduardo starts on bench for shakhtar
Off to arsenal agm this morning. Peter hill-wood always worth turning up for
See @johncrossmirror on Arsenal TV Online tonight - he's dressed in his best pink shirt. But has sensationally snubbed the pink tie combo
Corley services on way to manc for city arsenal. Seen lots of arsenal fans on the way
Nasri 1-2 with Arshavin and scores. Great goal. 1-0 Arsenal
Finished up at city. Arsenal ruthless. How good is nasri at the mo?
Thought arsenal did a job on silva. Kicked him a few times and he disappeared
 Some arsenal fans make me laugh. Accept you at least gave as good as you got today. That's a good thing, showed grit 
Thought chamakh lead the line really well for #arsenal today.
 Manchester evening news report on city v arsenal - 'steeped in skill, forged in steel and ruined by the rules' 
 @Arsenal_myview gibbs, wilshere, theo. They will all be big players for arsenal. Debate over. 
No arsenal press conference ahead of newcastle game 'because it's the carling cup'....
Obviously i'm biased but there should be arsenal press conferences ahead of c cup - even if it's a player instead of le boss
 As expected strong arsenal team: rosicky, theo, nb, koscielny and gibbs start 
GK og off the back of his head - Arsenal 1 up. Harsh on Krul
Great finish by theo but bendtner defo fouled the newcastle man arsenal 2-0
Cesc coming on for arsenal
Great finish by Bendtner Arsenal 3-0
Nice one Theo. Arsenal 4-0
Carling Cup is Arsenal's IF they really want it this season
 @JeromeCaminada As I said, just my opinion. Means more to Arsenal right now 
Made tough work of that Villa - not sure about the old no striker formation. Through though and just want to avoid United and Arsenal.
Guus Hiddink has just arrived at Arsenal's London Colney training ground...
Wilshere on verge of signing new 5year arsenal contract. See sat daily express for full story.
@jack_wilshere to sign new 5year Arsenal contract ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/208465/Arsenal-s-Jack-Wilshere-set-for-new-deal
Massive goals for chelsea and arsenal. City haven't quite developed that skill yet. No doubt they will though
 As we predicted on sat, wilshere signs new arsenal contract 
 Uh oh, major traffic probs on m25 which could bugger my journey to colney for arsenal presser and trip to donetsk 
 Arshavin, fabregas, song and denilson not made journey to donetsk with #arsenal. All minor knocks 
Diaby not travelled #arsenal
Diaby still struggling with ankle injury so not in donetsk #arsenal
It has always been disputed by arsenal how much comolli was involved in getting certain players. Henry was certainly all about wenger
More comolli - legend has it that at #arsenal he didn't fancy ruud van nistelrooy and refused to watch him more than once
Theo's on fire but Arsenal are rocking a bit after going ahead
Silly old Arsenal.
Waiting in airport with arsenal fans who remain upbeat. Fairly confident i have lucked the legroom seat again. Super duper
 This is a bitof a rubbish 2000th tweet, but @jackwilshere says Liam Brady is his role model on #arsenal website 
It was a very rubbish 2000th tweet because I linked the wrong Jack Wilshere! @Jack_Wilshere says Liam Brady is his role model on Arsenal web
#Arsenal Van Persie row with Dutch ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/209669/Holland-s-manager-stirs-up-row-over-Van-Persie-selection
Looking forward to #arsenal game tomorrow. Hope #newcastle have a go but expect a home win by a couple of goals.
 #arsenal's strongest bench for some time: arsh, vp, rosicky, bendtner, djourou, eboue, szczesny 
Arshavin coming on for #arsenal
I think chanmakh has generally started well for #arsenal but carroll was far more effective than him at both ends today.
No Arsenal press conference pre-Wolves. Boo
 Arsenal submit appeal against Koscielny red card on grounds of wrongful dismissal. If they win, he will be able to play v Wolves and Everton 
 @THBNtweets yep, unfortunately i'm watching your mob or arsenal every week!! 
C'mon arsenal fans show some humility. Stop banging on about henry and wolves' past tackles and admit mick acted superbly.
@DTguardian redknapp handed over to bond this week and arsenal did no pre-wolves. Becoming an increasingly worrying trend
Szczesny signs long-term contract at arsenal. Clichy and nasri next
Had e-mail and after no pre-wolves press conference #arsenal and wenger are doing a pre-everton press conference tomorrow. Hurrah
Non journo #ff - two arsenal fans who know their stuff @DarrenArsenal1 @JamieDalton82
Chris hughton's daughter working for sky at arsenal presser today. Weird
Bendtner: play me or i'll leave. Arsene says prove your confidence on the pitch. Interesting to see how this plays out #arsenal
 @JamieDalton82 Paul McGrath, im my lifetime, is Villa's but I wouldn;t expect Arsenal to sign him next week! 
 @mic_flair I've seen it, but a team with Theo, Nasri, Arshavin and Rosicky hardly need A Young as well. He's an Arsenal fan though 
I'm on arsenal tv online fans forum tomorrow night - does anyone actually ever watch it or will i be talking to 3 men in their pants?
 Arsenal press officer to me: 'hi matt, i like your shirt.' I win 
#ff an arsenal blogger and fan who liberally uses the word 'twat' @natashashenry
Message to 3 men in their pants: i'm leaving the house to go and do arsenal tv online fans forum. See all 3 of you at 8.15. Should be fun
 Nasri beats gomes to ball and scores from tight angle. Great by nas, terrible from gomes 1-0 arsenal 
Arsenal could win this by a few at this rate. Spurs keep giving the ball away and their defence are terrible at the moment. Look overrawed
Bentley responds to Arsenal crowd jeering him. The guy really is one of the biggest idiots in football
Didn;t see that coming. Silly by Arsenal but game on
Crouch on Theo coming on for Arsenal.
This is mad. Arsenal completely chucked it away. Credit to Spurs
Arsenal fans have given up and are leaving.
Disappointed with wenger explanation of arsenal defeat today. All winners are bad losers but he is especially bad. Harry buoyant
It appears arsenal fans can't read the words 'non-arsenal'!
Adebayor would be a great signing for Spurs. Harry would put his arm round his shoulder and get him playing. Arsenal fans will may disagree!
That is a disaster for arsenal. I sense a busy day tomorrow
 Rvp should be okay for arsenal for the weekend. Had pre-planned injection today, no major setback 
Sat in starbucks ahead of arsenal press conf listening to xmas music. Kill me
No @johncrossmirror at arsenal today so will do my best to tweet injury news. I often forget though so sorry in advance!
 As in today's daily express, wenger admits arsenal will have to manage cesc's fitness from now on and be more careful. Hammy is 2 weeks 
Told @WEDITSJET will prob stay at Arsenal after possible loan move to Crystal Palace didn't happen
Catch @johncrossmirror on the last ever arsenal tv online fans forum tonight. Watch out for his shirt - it will be a shocker.
He once wore a shirt so bad that the arsenal press officer and several football agents took the piss out of him - he's never worn it again!
Any screen pics of @johncrossmirror on arsenal tv online fans' forum?
@DarrenArsenal1 spurs v liverpool on sun. Shall be viewing vill v arsenal on telly
@akshay_gooner fair play to @johncrossmirror for almost wearing villa colours though on eve of villa v arsenal game. Good facial expression!
 @Gunnerian in all seriousness there is no better fleet st journo, including me, than @johncrossmirror when it comes to arsenal. 
Looks like the Arsenal fans have come out in support of the shirt worn by @johncrossmirror - no taste. Villa and Spurs fans have let me down
people wondering why i wasn't loving arsenal's first half perf yesterday - i'm a villa fan and i was watching through villa specs on day off
 @richthemaster yes, same old arsenal really - great going forward but far too open when should have closed game out. 
 No arsenal or west ham carling cup press conferences so only london press conf today is wigan, who are staying in hertfordshire 
Could really do with snow stopping and arsenal game going ahead. Villa can be anowed off tomorrow though - it will do us a favour
 Team to play Wigan: Szczesny, Eboue, Koscielny, Djourou, Gibbs, Denilson, Wilshere, Walcott, Bendtner, Van Persie (c), Vela #Arsenal 
No Almunia on the arsenal bench - James Shea instead
@DarrenArsenal1 thanks mate - let's have a villa-arsenal final
 C'mon arsenal, draw birmingham for me and put them back in their box 
No @johncrossmirror at arsenal today do i'll try to fill in with unembargoed team news for mr quick fingers himself
 Wenger reveals vermaelen in protective boot, fab could be two more weeks, almunia out and diaby still out #arsenal 
@littlemsgooner i'm afraid he seems extremely happy and settled at chelsea. Arsenal could have got him years and years ago....
 Also, wenger admits arsenal are lucky to still be in the title race having lost three home games this season 
Just met @10akhil at arsenal who tells me he'll take 'any win' i reckon arsenal 3-0 today. Vp to come on and get a goal
 Van persie getting ready to come on, arsenal on top but still nervous 
Theo on to clinch it for arsenal or will fulham sub a johnson be the hero?
Arsenal's Song and dance act ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/215707/Arsenal-2-Fulham-1-Song-and-dance-act-suits-Arsene-Wenger
I could swear i wrote in saturday's express that arsenal sources had confirmed vermaelen would def not play again this year. #justsayinglike
Off to arsenal press conference and training this morning. A win and only a win will do tomorrow night
Arsahvin has said arsenal have tried to improve their defending but can't so must simply score more than they concede...
 Arshavin also says arsenal have no chance of finishing top of group h tonight so must face prospect of drawing barca, real or b munich 
Arshavin: Arsenal cant defend - simples ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/216164/Andrey-Arshavin-s-backlash
Arsenal like it tough ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/216150/Now-Arsene-Wenger-has-to-paper-over-cracks-
 @johncrossmirror @matt_barlow_DM @laptopmirror oui to crossy bash, not sure on FA at the mo. Crossy excited by Arsenal vouchers 
I'm on the new Arsenal fans' forum tomorrow night at 6pm - desperately trying not to blow embargoes! ://www.arsenal.com/newfridaynight
Arsenal still confident they will eventually get a work permit for Wellington Silva on appeal. Legs to this one...
Just waiting to go on new look arsenal fans' forum - please ring in but go easy on me as i'm full of cold and am bravely battling through
Enjoyed arsenal fans forum tonight. New format good and took some really good calls - chamakh or van persie for united game was a big debate
 Off for two weeks - see you at arsenal, chelsea 
Encouraging noises around that cesc will be fit enough to at least make bench for #arsenal tonight but final decsision still yet to be made
Those asking whether szczes will play for arsenal tonight should ask @CharlieWyett - he broke story szczes could be in and i'm off today!
Well done @CharlieWyett for szczesny story today - as thought cesc on the subs bench for #arsenal tonight
I'd go fab on for wilshere and theo on for rosicky for #arsenal. United done great job on nasri so far and bossing centre of midfield
 I've been a big critic but thought koscielny was arsenal's best player tonight, maybe a turning point for him. V good szczesny debut too 
 So disappointing from arshavin, nasri, rosicky, vp and cham tonight - #arsenal need big players to put in big performances in big games 
I wish wenger had said 'we had a big chance to come here and lay a marker and i'm disappointed we didn't grasp it'. Arsenal were flat
 On a different subject @Benik_Afobe seems a very intelligent, nice young man who hopefully has big future for #arsenal and #england 
Who did arsenal fans' forum tonight - other than tom watt?
Merry christmas and happy new year to everyone. Back to work on the 27th for arsenal v chelsea - well rested a ready to go. Thanks for #ffs
Thanks again for all novel recs - now have a list as long as my arm to send @Mrsfifilaw out with. Arsenal v chelsea for me later...
Arsenal and chelsea to both win tonight but i think wenger has got his team selection wrong. Sure he's not bothered by what i think!
Gonna do a big new year #ff session later - just rattling through arsenal and spurs!
 Nice one arsenal, nice one 
Can understand arsenal taunts of boring boring city but is it really that bad that a team who got battered managed to hold on for a point?
City played pretty well in thrashing my shower so not always boring. Arsenal were superb in first half last night
 arsenal had enough chances, they could have won comfortbaly with better finishing/more luck. We already knew arsenal are better to watch 
 If arsenal go to barcelona in champs league, park the bus and get a 0-0 then arsenal fans will be very happy. 
 Right i've got arsenal fans, man city fans and now myself angry so off to the cooler! 
 No arsenal appeal on sagna. Out of leeds, ipswich, west ham 
Arsenal have offered samir nasri anew 5 year contract. Link later
The man with the best trainers in journalism on arsenal fans forum tonight @Matt_Barlow_DM - i've forgiven him for calling me a moron!
In the know arsenal fans @DarrenArsenal1 @JamieDalton82 @10akhil
Theirry henry is training with arsenal until january 19 after turning down loan offers from rival premier league clubs. #arsenal
Before anyone asks told 'no chance' of henry playing for arsenal while he trains with them. There to get fit and will help strikers.
Henry back at Arsenal ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/222205/Thierry-Henry-boosts-Gunners-
@YoungGunsBlog united and liverpool already linked to him - prob arsenal now too!
 Villa reserves 10, arsenal reserves 1. Play them v brum, certainly can't be worse than the first team at the mo! 
Beckham trains with Spurs and filmed live on SSN. Henry trains with Arsenal and not a pic of him in Arsenal kit on the website. Just saying.
 Dancing lady next to me very pleased and so she should be. Ipswich showing plenty of spirit, Arsenal not showing much of anything 
Wenger will say different but Arsenal took this one for granted.
 Also, west ham have shown an interest in sol campbell. Could be a straight replacement for upson if arsenal try to take hime back 
Breaking news - i'm on arsenal online fans' forum tomorrow night. Forget babestation or sky sports news!
 West ham will sell upson to 'sensible' offer. Arsenal want him on the cheap, sunderland interested too 
I'm on arsenal.com fans' forum in less than two hours. Fact
Good arsenal fans' forum tonight. Enjoyed calls and e-mails. Turned phone on to some very bizarre villa rumours which i'm v sceptical about
Arsenal leading chase for saints kid chamberlain but don't want to loan him back for the rest of the season
@DarrenArsenal1 agree - changes are totally understandable. Will be v tough game i think. Narrow arsenal win
@aindie2009 yeah it's true. Not sure on likelihood as arsenal dont want to pay too much for him
I'm told oxlade-chamberlain has agreed to join arsenal - only question left is if he moves this month or in the summer. Rejected liverpool.
Oxlade-chamberlain would rather play out season with saints and join arsenal in summer. Clubs haggling over that
@thefaults respect them all and all very knowledgable about arsenal
Can i make it clear that i support neither arsenal or saints so i really don't care where chamb plays. Just tweeting info from 3 sources
Mail on sunday seems to agree with me and @johncrossmirror about oxlade-chamberlain deciding to join arsenal
 When I told Wenger my I had been told Chamberlain has decided to join Arsenal, this is how he replied..... 
Expect Chamberlain to join Arsenal for £5m plus £5m add ons and be loaned back to Southampton
To those asking/worrying still assured oxo chamberlain wants to join arsenal but them and saints qubbling over structure of payments
@arsenal4ever2 i'm convinced he wants to join arsenal. Worried that saints trying to start an auction
@YoungGunsBlog treat entire story with care - arsenal say they know nothing about it
In the Arsenal press room watching Muzza. Arsene Wenger can be late today.
Omar ba ba on Arsenal fans' forum tonight. Quite a coup wouldn't you agree? @jimvanwijkPA
Can everyone who watches Arsenal fans' forum tonight please tweet me and @jimvanwijkPA to say whether he does look like omar ba ba? Thanks
Former arsenal midfielder edu has been training with west ham. He's 32 and has no club.
 @LordPrateek should be much clearer at the end of this weekend. Nothing really changed, he wants to join arsenal but clubs need to agree 
Still can't understand why arsenal v huddersfield is on tv tomorrow.
 Uh oh, pulled hammy is three weeks and arsenal play barca in two-and-a-half. Nasri out? 
Arsenal and southampton still talking over oxo chambo about move either now or in summer. Utd interested but told arsenal more likely
Heard arsenal bid for oxo chambo was 5mill plus 3 in add ons. Saints want far more up front and deal reaching 10.
Would make sense for arsenal to wait until summer for oxo - as long as utd don't come in with acceptable bid this arvo
 Just spoken to someone at arsenal. As expected, think it will be a quiet evening for me. 
 @MatthewLeGod no, i reported oxo wants to join arsenal which his dad then repeated on sky and he put on facebook! 
Don't thing bartley loan to rangers means anything except bartley loan to rangers if you get my drift arsenal fans?
@a_w_clasby reported he wants to join arsenal and his dad backed it up. Well done to saints for keeping hold of him till end of season
 In other arsenal news, Song set to miss Newcastle game but Theo is fit - no prob with his ankle. 
 C'mon Arsenal fans, stop being paranoid. There is no Cesc witch-hunt, simply reporting that he's upsetting a lot of people recently. 
 RT @goonerjon777 witch hunt wanting to drive cesc away, arsenal may win things, you are all scared - Do you take a lot of drugs? V paranoid. 
 @oliverhj84 I report on Arsenal, not Man Utd. 
Full Roo story for paranoid Arsenal fans ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/179758/Wayne-Rooney-warned-over-his-F-word-rant
Hands up those paranoid Arsenal fans who took too many drugs in their younger years....#stayoffthedrugskids
@ColmMac84 anti arsenal journo?! A bloke from the fa even accused me of being an arsenal fan yesterday!
I actually wish i was on arsenal.com fans' forum tomorrow night but sadly i'm not.
@cammonbear i did my job and suggested some arsenal fans are former drug addicts. The 2nd part was a joke despite what a swedish man says
wish i actually had seriously called arsenal fans crackheads and junkies.At least that would be something 2 really get pissed off with me 4.
Breaking news: @johncrossmirror on arsenal fans' forum tomorrow.
Arsenal presser was today so gonna go and see avram tomorrow and wish him good luck for their revenge match against the noses on sunday.
#ff @JamieDalton82 @10akhil @DarrenArsenal1 proper arsenal nuts
Oh. My. God. Arsenal
@SunSteveBrenner out of interest please tweet whether an arsenal player agrees to speak afterwards...
Did i say the ref had a great game? No. But that arsenal collapse still wouldn't have happened with a proper leader on the pitch.
 @Sawyer_Arsenal judging by that response, you're the moron 
All the people slagging me off name me a 'real' leader in that arsenal team? Not a great player or a great bloke or a tackler. A leader...
@goldenbhoy29 did i say that? But can arsenal control inept refereeing?
Who's going to be in that arsenal dressing room now making sure that never happens again? I bet it's head down and silence.
@mjl thought barton should have gone but arsenal should still have won
I am getting an awful lot of sensible replies from arsenal fans. Too many to retweet. It's the idiotic few who i highlighted
Any villa fans fancy a chat? We defo lack leaders and need a good shake. Should have won today. Didn't see game as watching arsenal feed
Arsenal reflections after watching again on MOTD...
Arsenal fans right to point out a bad challenge from barton on arsahvin not shown on Motd
 @10akhil i'm in minority but didn't think barton challenge on diaby was THAT bad. Re leaders, arsenal could do with some 
I think i can guess the arsenal opinion of neil barnett now
Djourou having tests tomorrow on his injury. #arsenal will be hoping for the best. No firm news yet
I did the interview with bendtner and didn't write up stuff on arsenal future...
I think he will ultimately leave but he would def stay and play for arsenal every week. I actually like him
 Eriken looking good - looks a lot like an arsenal player, prob too expensive for them though 
Can I start a campaign to have the arsenal scoreboard count up instead of down? Sure @MarkGonnella will agree.....
Voted for arsenal in the club hospitity awards today. Surely no contest?
@greavesmouse actually @Mrsfifilaw and @sammylambypie were while i wrote my arsenal match report. Is the fighter worth seeing?
Did interview with @jack_wilshere on sat and he agrees arsenal must get in the faces of barca and be a bity nasty. Looked very focussed
Good news arsenal fans - nasri trained yesterday and all went well. As long as no setback today he'll be in squad and could even start
 To summarise, barca will always be bitter arsenal did the best bit of business of the last decade and nicked cesc. #afc 
I just think laporta's words sum up the bitterness barca will always feel towards arsenal over cesc. They know they blundered massively
 Can you imagine the stick we'd give arsenal, utd, city or chelsea if they let a kid leave for free and then tried to buy him back 4 50mill? 
 @LooseCannon01 500,000 is daylight robbery for cesc! And how arsenal should celebrate that! 
Right off to arsenal training to see nasri dance around london colney and prove he's ready to take on barca! Hope arsene's in a good mood
Difference between ronaldo and cesc is that arsenal got cesc out of one of the biggest clubs in the world. Ronaldo didn't join utd from real
Injury crisis? Where are all the #arsenal players? ://yfrog.com/hskjurrj
Pep and iniesta both fairly dull tonight. Arsenal win the day of press conferences. Easily
Hadn't realised b4 today that barca have never won an away game in cl knockout stages under guardiola. Got a feeling for arsenal tomorrow
Wenger also says no point arsenal changing their style: if we hit long balls and do long throws then we have less chance. We are arsenal
 Arsenal probable: szczesny; eboue, djourou, koscielny, clichy; song, wilshere; walcott, fabregas, nasri; van persie 
My Arsenal Barca preview ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/229345/Arsenal-v-Barcelona-Arsene-Wenger-will-stick-to-guns
There's a rumour i'm on arsenal fans' forum on friday night. I will confirm or deny it later in the week
Interesting Barca journo does not think they are keeping the ball very well....Arsenal defo still in this though.
I thought arsenal lacked a leader at newcastle but entire team took responsibility tonight
 So, the rumour is true. I is arsenal fans' forum tomorrow. Brrrapp 
Just finished writing loooaaaadsss of arsenal for tomorrow's paper too. It's an arselona fest
Arsenal going four it (see what I did there?) ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/229762/Arsenal-go-four-it
#ff the only person at arsenal today @laura_mail
About to leave for arsenal fans' forum. Once again i will put @johncrossmirror to shame in the shirt stakes. Had a haircut as well
Really enjoyed arsenal fans forum tonight. Got loads of calls from fans and that's what makes the show. Keep calling in every week
@joeearley arsenal fan's forum!
@joeearley it's all about arsenal!
 Arsenal team v orient; almunia, sagna, miquel, squillaci, gibbs, song, denilson, rosicky (capt) bendtner, chamakh, arshavin 
@TC_Gooner told v strong arsenal bench
I got team right but captain wrong. Almunia has the armband #arsenal
 Arsenal bench: fab, koscielny, nasri, wilshere, clichy, eboue, szczesny 
 Right, which of those arsenal players should be shipped out in the summer then....? 
@Gunnerian yep but that's not an argument as to whether he's good enough for arsenal
 Only constant of players arsenal fans think should be sold is almunia. Otherwise, everyone suggesting different names... 
@Dav_Man i am but not many villa fans follow me and i watch arsenal every week for work. Would happily have a villa chat
@SamiSteinbock three to four weeks i heard. Prob miss arsenal though
 Do Arsenal fans who want AW to cancel press conferences still want journos to tweet Arse news, injury updates and reply to their questions? 
 Judging by Arsenal website's promotion of fake player twitter accounts, I would think newspapers still have a role to report on the club. 
Theo walcott fit for arsenal game v stoke tomorrow night. No prob with hamstring that kept him out of orient game
 @JeromeCaminada no worries, I've called Arsenal fans paranoid for less - and then got abused for it! 
 @Coggy1971 it's actually the opposit of lazy. I could have just nicked quotes off arsenal, stoke and beeb website but instead got a story 
@jamestwknowles 745 k/o and arsenal certainly need to focus on winning game and closing utd gap rather than focussing on shawcross
Arsenal's injury worries ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/230912/Final-agony-for-Arsenal-boss-Arsene-Wenger
Arsenal fans don't expect toral to be a tippy-tappy xavi or iniesta clone. I'm told he's far more robust and more traditionally english.
Off to carling cup final press conference at arsenal today where i believe i'll be speaking to arsene wenger and bacary sagna.
#ff arsenal fans this weekend @IanTaylor7 @avfccentral @MatKendrick @paullovesbeer @avfcbuzztap @Villa_Insider
Seems first cesc new that he wouldn't be playing in carling cup final was through arsenal.com - that is stretching the power of club web!
Cesc could still lift trophy if arsenal win on sunday. He is still going on sun and option of him lifting trophy has been discussed
Arsenal Carling Cup final preview ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/231320/Now-Arsene-Wenger-would-settle-for-any-old-silver-lining
@IanTaylor7 villa got to win as your first game as ambassador today. Got the arsenal shirt ready for tomorrow?
Told Arsenal request has gone in to League for Cesc to lift the trophy tomorrow if Arsenal win and if he so wishes
Feel for all the arsenal fans and szczesny but bigger battles are around the corner.
Jack wilshere's tweet shows the arsenal players are still dwelling on blues defeat. Need to move on now and forget everything about it
 What team would arsenal fans play v orient on weds. I'd go: sczces; sagna, kos, squill, gibbs; den, diaby; eboue, rosicky, bendtner; cham 
No arsenal press conf today but that was decided b4 carling cup final defeat so club not being bad losers - aw just cant be bothered again!
Van persie has knee ligament damage. I've been told out closer to six weeks rather than three. #arsenal
@stew_arts arsenal v orient later for me and just finished off some boring accounting. You having a busy day?
@IlianAngelov think last night will give arsenal a real lift again. They are capable of winning a cup its just if they can get over the line
@sammylambypie i'm at arsenal working so seperate towns
 Song out, fab 90 per cent certain to make it #arsenal 
 On plane ready for Barcelona. Law, cross, wyett all fit. Big boost for #arsenal 
 Rvp stepped up his #arsenal training today. Yes, yes, i know i said six weeks. No word on whether he's be back any sooner yet 
 Van perise added to arsenal cl squad at last minute. Massive, massive surprise 
Van persie would not travel if he was injured - arsenal players never travel to european games if they are not under consideration
Busquets to play in defence v arsenal with mascherano coming in as holding midfielder
Pep says of wilshere; it is good for him arsenal have time and no pressure to win titles quickly. We have players like him in the 2nd team
The van persie gamble ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/233262 #arsenal
My Barca v Arsenal preview ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/233256/Arsene-Wenger-says-Arsenal-s-only-chance-is-to-attack
Can already hear arsenal fans singing nasri song
 Teams out, flag saying catalonia is not spain out, music on. #barca v #arsenal. Really hope #arsenal do it 
That van persie sending off was one of the most ridiculous i've ever seen. That wasn't the only reason for #arsenal defeat but big issue
 #arsenal good games: almunia, djourou, koscielny, despite pen, and wilshere. 
 #arsenal bad games; vp (not fit), cesc (not fit), both full backs, diaby, rosicky 
@iamsleazebag watch the first half again - he saved #arsenal at least twice
On plane now - arsenal fans i've bumped into seem philosophical. Disappointed arsenal didnt use brief moments of possession better
My Barca v Arsenal match report ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/233490/Barcelona-3-Arsenal-1-Lionel-Messi-sinks-Arsenal
 As part of my new policy of not spending entire day on twitter, I'm off now. Will leave #arsenal press conf updates to @johncrossmirror 
#ff top arsenal fans @RussJefferys @DarrenArsenal1 @JamieDalton82 @ladyarse @10akhil
Where's that fella who was killing me saying i hate arsenal and tweeting szczes about me? They never pipe up when u say something positive.
 Arsenal look a bit one-pcaed when theo not in team. I'd get in another speed king in summer, even if he's essentially a squad player 
Arsenal have checked with premier league they can sign a free agent and are in talks with lehmann. Should be done for wba game
Lehmann quote: 'Arsenal currently have a goalkeeping crisis and i jumped at the chance to help them.'
Arsenal injury news - fabregas and walcott both unlikely to be ready for wba and struggling for spain and england too
 Are there any arsenal players not on twitter? Surely the best-represented PL club on here. Not sure that is a good thing, mind 
Going to ask wenger if arsenal can complete the single. Who needs trebles and quadruples?!
Amazing how many journos who must have been at arsenal to tweet the team news - it didn't seem very busy here!
Club' being arsenal of course
I don't think arsenal will appeal one-gam bans for wenger and nasri. But i do think tottenham will rightly appeals jordan's
Just pulled into emirates for #arsenal fans' forum - ring in from six. Expecting a spikey one!
Arsenal win today with cesc and theo due back after internationals will have evryone believing. Anything but a win and i think it's curtains
 I'm talking about villa, not arsenal. Still think arsenal will win 
By the way i'm in west london cause i'm covering chelsea man city today. Stayed out arsenal debate cause yet to see highlights
Interviewed jack wilshere and scott parker yesterday - both great credits to their clubs and country. They would b great together at arsenal
@Sawyer_Arsenal @Matt_Barlow_DM tells me vuvuzelas are banned and there announcements outside Wembley asking for fans not to bring them in
Really admire the Arsenal tributes to David Rocastle. People sometimes ask why I refer to Arsenal as being classy. This is a great example.
My paper didn't think this was worth using today but theo walcott has told arsene wenger to start him 4 arsenal tomorrow...
 @jack_wilshere it's after midday...which means you do have to leave arsenal and join villa on a free transfer. Sorry, thems the rules 
I hear a rumour @GuardianJamieJ is on arsenal fans' forum tonight. He loves a sex-themed slogan t-shirt
@Sawyer_Arsenal i've made it v clear before - i don't think wilshere should go to the u21s
 Sorry arsenal and west ham fans, i have to support manchester united today. #villarelegationnotanoption 
Amazed at arsenal fans ironically cheering almunia - do you actually want him to drop the ball into the net?
Nearly time for two up top - only need one holding midfielder. Get chamakh on #arsenal
Can i stress what the arsenal website put up straight after games from wenger is a different interview from the one the papers do later on
@avaehe th job dictates i mainly cover arsenal. Watch them nearly every week
That's my last bit of Arsenal for a few days - making a reverse-Sol switch to Spurs for their Champions League game in Madrid.
 Spoke to adebayor after the game last night. I understand arsenal fans' issue with him but always found him polite, well-spoken and friendly 
 Could resist a bit of super furries 'hello sunshine' on my way into arsenal training ground today.. 'I'm a mingerrrr, you're a minger too..' 
Any arsenal fans who want info on their new signing carl jenkinson should follow 'mr charlton' himself @greavesmouse - then unfollow again!
An actual celeb on arsenal fans' forum tonight - the actual brother of wolf from gladiators. If you dont believe me ring in and ask him
Everyone should greet @jimvanwijkPA on arsenal fans' forum tonight with an 'awooga'. Brother of wolf from gladiators
@ashburton_grove Like a shot. Would you as an Arsenal fan?
@ashburton_grove Said all along that when Wenger leaves Arsenal will no longer be guaranteed top four - not to start with anyway
@cjor1172 yes he did really say that otherwise expect me to be banned from arsenal for making up quotes
I'm struggling to think of another club who have had thier first four keepers injured at the same time #arsenal
For villa reasons i'm very much supporting arsenal
Arsenal. Villa. Masters. Sun is overrated anyway
 Generally much better perf from arsenal. Fabregas at his best, diaby better and vp looking sharp. Is jens number 1 for liverpool game? 
 Arsenal news ruined last 15 mins of villa for me but good result and much needed, if not convincing 
@Gingers4Limpar in all seriousness @johncrossmirror is no1 journo for arsenal. Knows and understands the club like none of the rest of us
Written lots of arsenal today - saved thoughts and info for the paper. #radical
Arsenal's fight club ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/240198/Arsenal-s-fight-club
Never met or spoken to danny fiszman but always sad when somebody dies. Sure he will be well remembered for a long time at arsenal
 As expected Szczesny likely to return with Djourou against Liverpool for Arsenal on Sunday. If fit, both must start #afc @AllBabble 
@Andrew_Bone as in arsenal have most definitely invited red bulls and are confident it will happen. Not quite signed and sealed. Tsk tsk
I have taken home the bags of @johncrossmirror today because he's running the marathon and then going straight to arsenal-liverpool. Mad
Morale dilema at arsenal today. On leaving training ground asked by youngster to sign an arsenal shirt. Clearly had no idea who i was ...
@steviego85 mainly city with a bit of Arsenal!
@Sawyer_Arsenal ou're right modric has but suggestions bale is average are annoying me. He is a very good player
 If Barca do bid £35m for Cesc, would Arsenal fans sell or force him to stay for a second successive year? @AllBabble 
 Fortunately, I do also have some other Arsenal news that will be in tomorrow's paper that has not already been tweeted by @YoungGunsBlog !! 
Dont get too excited - my arsenal news is nothing to do with cesc and nothing major. But def worth reading - obviously!
@RobbieDMcDonald he was a scout at arsenal b4 going to spurs
Just finished up at arsenal - big news is @shauncustis slapped me on the wrists for swearing on twitter. Now on a swearing ban!
#ff arsenal dignitaries @DarrenArsenal1 @JamieDalton82 @10akhil @legrove @YoungGunsBlog @ladyarse @garyprince @YouAreMyArsenal
Spoke to @RealRomfordPele for an arsenal piece in tomorrow's paper on how fergie has gained the advantage on wenger. Top man.
@garyprince @DarrenArsenal1 i did ask him that but he said cesc will be a much stronger captain once arsenal win
@SamiSteinbock yep - actually fancy arsenal now the pressure has lifted
Unfortunate arsenal prog interview with nasri given french football allegations. Nasri: 'laurent blanc has a good philosophy and it reminds
 Me a bit of arsenal, which is what i like.' Assume this was done well before the race allegations!!!! 
I've criticised arsenal for not talking at times this season too. So no bias. Always annoys me when losing side sneak off - and then tweet!
@mdouble_ue No worries - t word doesn't bother me. Wasn't just kicking Utd - did point out I've said same about arsenal this season.
@GoonersForever football reporter (arsenal and england monkey)
George Graham: I'd have been sacked by Arsenal by now ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/244457/George-Graham-Cups-or-bust

Doing my best here #ff @habmaj @smudgysmudge @villagabe @liamlancscc @sawyer_arsenal @bishy613 @blake2108 @bonehead4 @DonieHartney @lordfimm
@RussJefferys arsenal have a far far higher wage bill
Oh yes and early Arsenal team news for Sun. Told Fabregas will definitely return from injury to play against Villa. Oh joy.
 Please read what I wrote - Diarra to be offered to Arsenal. Wenger may well say 'non, merci', but he may say 'oui, d'accord' as well! 
My final @Arsenal fans' forum appearance of the season tomorrow. Might do a 'lap of appreciation' at the end of it.
 @goonercody yep villa fan, report on arsenal. 
 Parker has dropped a big hint he's leaving west ham and i hear (in no order) liverpool, arsenal and tottenham are leading the chase. 
 I would also like to #ff @RussJefferys today - big arsenal fan, marathon man and helping to organise a triathalon around canary wharf 
 ...Talking of my shirt you can see it on @arsenal fans forum from 6pm tonight. That link was smooth, yah? 
 On @arsenal fans forum in 20 mins - call in and ask my anything - well, almost anything! 
 Oops, it seems we're on a bit later tonight - 6.25pm to quiz me on @Arsenal fans forum. 
Off to arsenal v villa later. Villa could do with another point and arsenal need to secure 3rd. Still feels a bit 'nothingy' though.
Villa players clearly trying to do Arsenal a favour and ensure Wilshere doesn;t play in U21 C'ships. Living v dangerously at the mo
 Arsenal's start was terrible. Squillaci has been an appalling signing. Van persie excellent again, but changes required 
My Arsenal-Villa report ://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/246985/Arsenal-1-Aston-Villa-2-All-Bent-out-of-shape
 Football clubs i've written about today in no particular order: arsenal, west ham, man city. 
 @paulgbates pound on arsenal, pound on liverpool and pound on spurs 
Last arsenal press conference of the season here i come - hope wenger sends us out with a bang!
Japanese journalists travel thousands of miles to ask arsene wenger about ryo miyaichi and arsenal put it straight out as live. Seems unfair
 So, what am i going to do on thursdays and fridays with arsenal pressers to go to? Must say staff at colney always treat us brilliantly. 
I mainly wrote about arsenal west ham and birmingham today. So there.
Arsenal must follows @johncrossmirror @CharlieWyett @Matt_Barlow_DM @JWTelegraph @JamieDalton82 @DarrenArsenal1 @YoungGunsBlog @10akhil
 Other than usual names, told arsenal have also watched lorient defender bruno ecuele manga - they signed his as a replacement for koscielny! 
Arsenal's tour to china and malaysia is only 2 games and they will be very light - cant see why that would harm wilshere. Not saame as u21s
Spent day with @jack_wilshere and dad andy (and other reporters). V engaging and interesting. Eng and arsenal future in safe hands
 @JamieDalton82 tott faves, west ham want 10 mill which could put arsenal off 
@Jonnyarsenal Not really. Nasri has options and staying at Arsenal is just one of them. I think he'll end up staying but he needs convincing
 Chelsea, west ham, arsenal and @jack_wilshere written by moi in tomorrow's express. Toodle pip 
 Dear arsenal fans @10akhil just sent me the following message: 'up the villa'. He's seen the light, well done akhil! 
Peter crouch on his england anger and capello and walcott on why arsenal must buy and could lose stars in express today
 Arsenal fans, you can be a funny bunch. Kill wenger for not spending money, kill liverpool for spending money. Make your minds up! 
 Right, I'm off to chase a rumour that Arsenal are preparing a £50mill bid for for a 12-year-old Middlesbrough player. See ya. 
Arsenal fans follow new signing @carl_jenkinson - he knows friend of the stars @greavesmouse dont you know. Show him lots of support
 As @JamieDalton82 has outed this i may as well add my two bob now. Arsenal had nid accepted for jones, spoke to him last night and... 
@seangibson238 arsenal
Some cesc fabregas and arsenal news in today's express.
 @Deleer no - it's only barca or arsenal for him. Makes transfer v tricky. But he is NOT unhappy at arse, just loves barca too. Wont go away! 
More on bid for clichy and arsenal transfers in express tomorrow
 @LucaHelvetica Thanks - I doubt it, more a case of throwing the balls in the air and seeing which ones land in Arsenal's court 
 @JamieDalton82 oi, i'll star bneing nasty about arsenal if you're not careful 
@JonnyOneill United can't believe arsenal have allowed to get down to one year. They think it's bad housekeeping
Anyone spot this from lille's general director freddy paquet; 'gervinho is in contact with Arsenal....
 ...'We will discuss with the London club because we follow the will of the player.' Gervinho wants arsenal, arsenal want him! 
@pdmckenna @henrywinter not convinced Samba is good enough for Arsenal
@OllieHoltMirror and at arsenal i knew full well it was an arsenal demise story and not a glory glor villa story after win at emirates
 @aindie2009 i personally dont think samba is arsenal standard. Man u, chelsea or even city wouldnt sign him 
Basically arsenal and barca are 20mill apart in their valuation of him. Arsenal value him at 50 but barca value him at 30.
@GandhiAFC Nasri is a big fan of Gervinho - told friends a long time ago Arsenal had to sign him. I don't write the headlines
Here's a thought for arsenal; when wenger sells clichy does he spend 15mill on new left back or move vermaelen there and buy 2 centre backs?
Pretty sure there is a borussia dortmund bid in for bendtner but also pretty sure if falls below arsenal's valuation. Haggling to b done.
@behnisch agree nb's dad can be 'creative' but arse seem to think interest from dortmund is real. Arsenal's 12mill asking price is unreal!
 Also, Newcastle want about £6million for Jose Enrique who Arsenal have enquired about as a replacement for Clichy 
Barcelona had a first summer bid of 27 million for fabregas rejected. Arsenal have told them to get real and bid closer to 50 mill
I also understan arsenal perspective and asking price - comparable to torres - so v v hard to guess on middle ground between the clubs
@IamTatts from arsenal's point a view defo worth over 27mill but just saying i can see barca logic in making that first bid.
@barcastuff I like to stand my stories up - maybe check with Arsenal press office when I made my first call on this story...
Christening of my nephew charlie today. One of the few occassions the phone will be off all day for. Cesc + arsenal can wait until monday
Really hope arsenal fans don't go too mad if/when cesc goes - club in between a rock and a hard place. Situation needs sorting now
@Sawyer_Arsenal fool
Arsenal have made contact with bolton about signing gary cahill. Deal in progress. Main story in london edition of today's express
Full cahill/fabregas #arsenal story should be here ://bit.ly/l1PySD
 @MarcSpurs arsenal prepared to offer choice of lansbury, eboue, jet, traore 
 @bbqbobs yes, there would be cash too. Cahill wants to join arsenal if poss 
You can all stop asking me now - @johncrossmirror is back. Surely he'll get things moving with arsenal... #groundhogday
@E_Z1ya - i would ring arsenal and fabregas' people to say i'd overheard it and take it from there
Tennis meant this didn't make the paper: Arsenal were last night trying to haggle Barca up closer to the 40mill mark for Cesc. Talks ongoing
I think a compromise will be reached with add-ons so both Arsenal and Barca can claim victory over the Cesc fee. PR game now.
Lots of questions RE Nasri - United interest seems real. As far as I know Nasri still not made a firm decision and Arsenal not given up hope
My decorator is an arsenal fan - he says sell anyone who won't commit - wise words in myy opinion
@arse2mouse i dont know about that. What i do know is that we all get things wrong but john cross is the best arsenal reporter on the beat
@David_Powles prob about 5 got to do some work on arsenal and will then head over.
Cesc wants Arsenal return to be a flying visit ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/256683/Cesc-Fabregas-hopes-for-a-flying-visit …
 Okay, sod twitter today. I'm hungover and can't be arsed with the knobs. Off to make up stories about arsenal losing all their players. Bye 
@ArsenalFCView yes i am desperate for cesc and nasri to leave and arsenal to go down the toilet. That would do my career wonders
@ArsenalFCView i am the arsenal reporter and i happen to like reporting on a champs league club. Thats how their success affects my career
@ArsenalFCView and i think arsenal are letting the fans down by increasing season tickets after lack of success
@AFChymnSheet yes i do write anything other than 'bad' arsenal news
@Macho_Grande1 because arsenal fans are upset at the mo but they come on twitter and blame journos.
 @BumperGraham i know, i was kidding - some arsenal fans killing me! I find it v interesting where cesc would be played and how.. 
I have a bit of positive news for arsenal fans but u will have to buy tomorrow's paper or wait for link tomorrow #notalldoomandgloom
Arsenal in Mata talks/Nasri going on tour/Cesc not on tour ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/257262/Arsenal-boss-Arsene-Wenger-gets-to-heart-of-Juan-Mata …
 Spent last half-hour logged into @jwtelegraph arsenal webchat, shame he answered precisely none of my questions. Bastard. 
@timpayton no - office offered me arsenal tour or a week in rio at end of july for world cup draw. I must admit i picked rio!
@timpayton if i'm brutally office looking forward to a week off arsenal!!!
 @barcastuff let's stick to public messaging eh? Guardiola unhappy with rosell's tactics, as are arsenal. Factoring toral and bellerin... 
 I'm not on arsenal tour, picked world cup draw in rio later this month, so follow @johncrossmirror and @jwtelegraph ... 
I should make it clear i do not have an 'official' arsenal tour list - just going off what i've been told.
Thanks for pointing out official arsenal touring party now on web. No real surprises.
@JamieDalton82 hopefully as that would equal a good summer for both arsenal and me!
But here is a thought. IF arsenal refuse to sell cesc for 35m then it will be exactly the same next summer and barca will offer even less..
@Riderofrohan i'm not going to argue with this. Arsenal don't even dispute he's been training on his own and with sol.
This seems to have slipped under radar even though in paper this morning. Cesc is not expected to go to cologne with arsenal squad on fri
Arsenal stay in germany until wednesday at a training camp after the cescless cologne friendly on saturday
One #ff today - special for arsenal fans @thescuffler
Arsenal news in tomorrow's express. Can't link cause in cologne so try buying it #lessthancrisps
@Arsenal_Kooora yes - slow burner
Have a pop at me if you like arsenal fans but it's not me who's messed up the nasri contract situation.
 @TheArsenal_ morning. If player verbally agrees, you get contract straight in front of him. Arsenal didn't. #messeditup 
Goal - gervinho scores on arsenal debut after 7 mins. Wilshere ball over and gervinho lobs keeper. Fair to say that is a good start
Big gaps in arsenal defence at mo - podolski shoots wide
Arsenal made 10 subs. Rvp and nasri now on
 Look, this is a friendly and i am not arsenal website. I'm not listing all the subs. So there. 
Heard there could be a little surprise for arsenal fans at today's emirates cup
Well as the rumour is doing the rounds - may as well tweet my arsenal surprise...
I hear plan is for thierry henry to get 15 mins (ish) in an arsenal shirt today.
I love it when a plan comes together - but they dont always so threats of death if Thierry doesnt pull on an arsenal shirt today seem harsh
I would assume henry will only get his 15 mins if arsenal are already a few goals up
 So, someone i follow give me a brief rundown of arsenal game today... 
Tricky with transfer window open and business to be done but still sure come sept 1 arsenal's squad will be stronger than liverpool's
I do agree tho that liverpool moving forwards while arsenal in danger of stalling. But arsenal squad still stronger at mo
 @David_0Leary who knows - it could go to the wire, meaning he may start the PL season for arsenal. Champs League play off a no-no though 
So who do arsenal fans want/not wants in champs league draw. Don't really see any of the teams as much of a problem
Majority saying they want arsenal to avoid kazan - from a press trip perspective i agree. Pile your money on arsenal drawing kazan! #jinx
Arsenal should be okay v udinese - decent place to visit for away leg too
Pretty sure arsenal will say cesc still recovering from hamstring and not match fit as reason behind not going to portugal...
@Sawyer_Arsenal for what? Getting stories? Questioning bad decisions? Not agreeing with everything he does? Being suspicious of hamstrings?
 Fascinated to hear what the only english journo in portugal, @CharlieWyett , makes of arsenal's arrival without cesc. 
@YouAreMyArsenal given his non-appearance in portugal i now think more likely he won't play for arsenal during august. That is a theory tho
 PL champs: man utd. CL places: man city, chelsea, arsenal. FA Cup: man utd. Carling cup: chelsea 
Spain buzzing with rumours @johncrossmirror doing first arsenal fans forum of season tonight #unmissable
Best for everyone cesc is now done. Arsenal should thank him and move on. Big worry is if nasri now follows...
In terms of incoming signings - arsenal after jadson and has gary cahill watched at weekend in case another bid for jag fails
 Ok arsenal fans, you've got at least 50m in bank and maybe another 23m to come. Who realistically do you sign in next 2 weeks to win league? 
For those asking about mata - i'm as confused as you are. A couple of weeks ago he told an arsenal player he was joining...
It seems arsenal then dragged their feet and then weng says no chance on fri. Will ask again today now cesc has actually gone
@DBCloggy initial payment may be just under but future payments will comfortably get arsenal 35m pounds
Frankly amazed so many arsenal fans saying they want scott dann - i sniff desperation. Put samba in the desperado category as well
Writing up my arsenal stuff with myleene klass sat in front of me. Wonder what she thinks about fabregas?
Shame eboue has left arsenal - he was a funny little fella
Van persie best choice as new arsenal captain. Considered the 'heartbeat' of the squad in the dressing-room. Also speaks mind.
Wenger to weighing up arsenal bid for yann m'vila. So there
 Just to clarify, all journos last night checked with arsenal and were told to treat the nasri quotes as genuine. He will go. 
 Ok, so journos at arsenal for game, see nasri quotes, ask arsenal press office if account is real, told yes and told story ok to print... 
Arsenal interested in Yann M'Vila ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/265556/ …
 Even if uefa banned managers from the stadium, messages would be communicated. Can't see messages made a marked difference to arsenal 
Can anyone tell me why l'equipe were banned for arse v udinese. Very unlike arsenal to go to such measures...
 Anyway, arsenal fans have to support barca to get full fee for cesc. Trust you're all in your braca 'fabregas 4' shirts?!...

Trying to think of a probable arsenal line-up for staurday's liverpool game is not easy...
 @CaptainBradH been off today, so no idea! At arsenal presser tomorrow 
#ff the arsenal twitterati @DarrenArsenal1 @10akhil @JamieDalton82 @ladyarse @ashburton_grove @GoonerTalk @garyprince
And last #ff today for @RussJefferys - a man constantly living in pain thanks to running too much and supporting arsenal
Here's something to annoy arsenal fans: i don't think samir nasri has done anything wrong.
Arsenal had the chance to sort nasri's contract and didn't. Now an employer with more money and better prospects want to hire him
 Arsenal also had chance to show nasri ambition in transfer window. But, again, let that chance pass 
I can see why nasri will be called greedy but this move is as much about what's wrong with arsenal as what's wrong with him.
That it just my view - v interesting debate whether nasri or arsenal to blame for all this
 Wenger in fighting mood today - not prepared to be kicked, even if arsenal are slightly down at mo 
 Having heard arsenal's explanation of what happened on tuesday night, i cannot believe uefa are pursuing case against wenger. So petty. 
@Abd_al_Rahman79 led to believe sky could even help arsenal's defence so they are not the bad guys in this
 @philmcnulty after seeing wenger today, really think arsenal will win. He seemed v fired up and determined 
Negative of dalglish to leave suarez on bench with arsenal so depleted
Maybe this is an elaborate ploy by Arsenal players to make Wenger buy
Going to reserve views on arsenal for the paper. Wenger fronted up to press and dalglish was interesting too.
Will be amazed if arsenal don't improve offer for m'villa. Told he's the one wenger really wants. Dunno if rennes have a selling price
Hands up if you think 'silent' stan should stop being so silent and actually tell the arsenal fans what direction he wants to take the club.
 Doubt stan kroenke is on twitter but if his pr people are, arsenal fans want him to talk. As they say in th us, let's get it oooonnnnnn. 
 @JonnyOneill @David_0Leary i take your point on spurs jonny, but that doesn't address arsenal issues at all. 
@David_0Leary @JonnyOneill most of us will be in sofia having to churn out pages of capello and jt. Can't see arsenal getting much space
@kraigmumblecore fair point but he got sent off and arsenal would probably have drawn otherwise. It's more a 5 for stupidity
 Think mata is a great signing for chelsea, just what they need - even more than modric. Still amazed arsenal didn't complete the deal 
Don't know exactly why arsenal didn't complete mata deal. Player had even asked a (then) arsenal player about the club and where to live..
Subsequently told arsenal didn't complete because contrary to what we all thought mata was not enger's first choice and nasri deal not done
 @johnnie_jackson @greavesmouse he's a jinx! Yeah tough times at arsenal. Off to udinese with them, badly need a result - and some signings! 
@ladyarse i don't think i've ever been wrong - apart from my prediction arsenal would beat liverpool!!
Arsenal travelling with 18-man squad to udine
How did it ever get to this for Arsenal? ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/266865/It-s-the-Samir-old-story-Arsene-Wenger …
Ian Ridley on Arsenal ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/266864/Arsene-Wenger-must-buy-into-modern-transfer-ideal …
Predicition for tonight: Udinese 1 Arsenal 1 - Arsenal to win 2-1 on aggregate and progress. Just.
I will be on arsenal fans forum on friday though so can reply to all opinions then
Udine press have picked out walcott as arsenal's danger man and say asamoah is the man to win for them
For the record everyone i've spoken in udine think arsenal are going to win - inc udinese fans
So Arsenal are through. Nice one arsene.
My arsenal match report ://bit.ly/qCAoMb 
Dunno why but transfer news cut out my arsenal stuff. New 21mill bid for m'vila is in and bolton reject new cahill offer. Will sell 4 17m
So arsenal have six days to spend 60mill - i somehow think selling clubs are going to set their prices high #timetocoughup
@YankeeGunner @arsenalreport we all have our opinions on the game which is fine. Mine was arsenal got out of jail and weren't great
Getting lots of questions where i think arsenal will finish this season - sticking with prediction of 4th but at least 2 signings needed
 @JsMills @YankeeGunner @arsenalreport bitterness at what? I'm a villa fan, b4 i was a reporter i didn't care either way about arsenal 
 With news liverpool might take bellamy back, would arsenal fans fancy him? Weng has always really liked bellers but not heard he's after him 
I'm on arsenal fans' forum tomoz and happy to talk about media relationship with wenger if anyone wants to ring in about it.
To be clear wenger cancelling paper press conf will not be reflected in how i write on arsenal. I dont agree with it but wont go that route
Arsenal wont have to do much homework on marseille - they've been scouting a group of their players for the last 6 months
My weekend goes something like this -  fri: arsenal fans forum. Sat: chelsea norwich. Sun: sunday supplement debut and spurs v man city.
 And of course, lots more arsenal in tomorrow's paper 
 @ashburton_grove big difference is arsenal wanted to sell clichy and weren't offering new deal, and he was by no means best player 
Arsenal tv press conference absolute chaos today
Just arrived at emirates for arsenal fans' forum - ring in and give me hell! Oh and watch car crash tv (press conference) first!!
This must be a first - was warned by arsenal they were worried i'd recieve abuse on fans' forum tonight because of twitter!!
But there was nothing to worry about as abusers (!) stayed away and i thoroughly enjoyed it. Really good arsenal debate.
Bolton and Arsenal in Cahill war ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/267505/Arsene-Wenger-Twitter-war-over-Gary-Cahill- …
@Sawyer_Arsenal i think you've got enough to worry about at old trafford.
@arsenalreport that's why i said bolton have claimed arsenal made a 6m bid - did not just state it as matter of fact
 @arsenalreport but remembr, i do not write for the arsenal programme or a club fanzine. We are not bias either way 
@Large_Goat good point although dont know if arsenal paid wages
Lots of early debate on this striker arsenal seem to be signing - let's see him first eh? But mid and def should be priority
Fascinating stuff from @johncrossmirror on talksport press pass about arsenal right now
At last count arsenal have enquiries or bids lodged for at least four midfielders in hope one comes off before deadline #panic
 Totally agree arsenal must make signings - so strange to see them scrambling around all over the place going into final day, though. 
 Arsenal bids in for M'Vila, Hazard, Martin - enquiries made yesterday on Arteta and Fellaini. Sure there are others too, Busy day ahead 
 Obviously, arsenal will not sign all those players. One more, or two max i would have thought 
How will arsenal fans feel if they just end up with benayoun today? Not saying that's going to happen but keen to get opinion
Hear blackburn not expecting to sell samba today. Arsenal big priority is midfielder now anyway
Told arsenal is a mad-house today and they're working v v hard to get a midfielder. No definitive progress as yet though
Hearing Arsenal gone in strong this arvo for Arteta - think he's one
Think arsenal hoping to get arteta for around 10mill
Two issues on arsenal arteta move - may have to go above 10m and everton need to have a player-in lined up. Arsenal remain hopeful
 Uh-oh, arteta arsenal very much off as week speak 
My arsenal doomsday scenario of finishing the day with just benayoun is looking most likely at the moment. Dear oh dear oh dear.
Arsenal still working hard
Got to be careful what i say but something other than yossi MAY still happen for arsenal. No better than 50-50 at mo though
Still think 10m will be arteta move - told he really wants arsenal move
John Terry thinks Walcott should be an Arsenal striker after hitting four in training ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/268707/Theo-Walcott-s-striking-form …
Do Arsenal fans agree Theo Walcott should be given a chance up front for Arsenal? John Terry amazed when Walcott scored 4 in Eng training
With the new signings and theo form i'd like arsenal to go 4-3-3 v swansea next week...
 Paper also reports bulgarian football fans prefer to watch arsenal, united and liverpool than national team 
 If manchester city really want to get on arsenal's nerves, they'll sack garry cook and replace him with david dein. 
Vermaelen had secret ankle surgery last night and out for at least a month - will link shortly. Massive blow to arsenal and him
 @northbanklower not really, no. Just think it is now clearly ridiculous to complain about 'arsenal bashing' in the press... 
@northbanklower i read far more arsenal bashing on here and on blogs than i do in papers..
@Sawyer_Arsenal blocked
@northbanklower he was very good yes. I don't remember ever saying arsenal spent too much on him
@JonnyOneill i see that point but arsenal have been in a position to be judged against very best - not liverpool and spurs
 @JonnyOneill because over recent years arsenal's competition has been utd and chelsea, not liverpool or spurs 
 @JonnyOneill well, no, you're not any more. you've just made arsenal sound a bit like stoke. Not sure arsenal ever 'slug it out'! 
 @JonnyOneill ha, wenger's taught me well. Arsenal are judged differently under aw because of what he achieved... 
@JonnyOneill personally think it's sad so many arsenal fans want to be judged against spurs at the mo
@JonnyOneill The day we stop writing about you not winning and get bored with arsenal is when you'll know the game's really up
@JonnyOneill it's a massive refelection of what wenger achieved that arsenal are still so relevant after so long without trophy
Assured walcott fit for arsenal - left out as precaution/tactic
 Talksport, BT, radio 5, absolute radio, sky news, al jazeera, chelsea tv, arsenal tv, espn and now #sundaysupplement @johncrossmirror 
@JonnyOneill what's your arsenal team v swansea jonny?
@JonnyOneill i wouldnt have aa anywhere near the team. Think his attitude towards arsenal has been shite for a while now
 Stayed up late to record a podcast with @beyondthepitch - talked man city, spurs, liverpool, arsenal and wolves. No villa unfortunately! 
 I wasn't at arsenal today. Reading tweets i'd have thought they had lost. Reading results, they won. Villa drew, i'm pleased. 
When was the last time arsenal were left until second from last on motd?
Off to dortmund with Arsenal tomoz - told the stadium is fantastico so looking forward to that. Not a fan of the big german sausages though!
 As we are flying with arsenal team, kept imagining what bergkamp would have been like with plane being thrown all over the place 
Subotic says Arsenal have 'a big problem' ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/270999/Arsenal-s-big-problem …
 And, in their words, when gotze does leave dortmund he will join a bigger club than arsenal 
Pat rice was good in post-match interview - would have asked if he was resigning if arsenal lost
 When asked if he was angry with arsenal goal, klopp said: 'yes, but shit happens.' 
My Dortmund v Arsenal match report ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/271209/Borussia-Dortmund-1-Arsenal-1-Arsene-Wenger-thanks-his-lucky-stars …
 Havent tweeted much about arsenal-dortmund, although did link my match rep earlier. My player scores would be as follows... 
Bacary Sagna is officially arsenal's unsung hero - consistently v good and probably the nicest man at club. Among best full-backs in europe
 @brett1892 villa, write about arsenal 
@christoronyi sorry chris i'm going to struggle - v busy tomorrow due to arsenal press conf. Many apologies
Standing still will be an achievement for Arsenal ://bit.ly/qrK0AF 
@J_Hinds_london expectation in last 6 years was still to win a trophy - i don't think it is any more. Arsenal are fighting to keep up.
 @saskiey agree, not knocking the draw. But i think it illustrates where arsenal currently find themselves 
@JeromeCaminada haha - i don't think arsenal fans think i'm wenger's PR
@JeromeCaminada my point is that given the new order in the PL and CL arsenal will do well to stand still this season
How twitter works: arsenal fans upset by me saying standing still will be an achievement. United fan accuses me of being wenger's PR man!
@goonersparx @DarrenArsenal1 arsenal's draw was both well earned and lucky but that wasn't my point
@MarkLawrenceafc i report on arsenal - and i'm trying to block out villa's performances!
 @ObumOsigwe write, not right. That was pretty poor. And yes arsenal might stand still and villa be relegated. 
@timpayton @eastlower not to mention fact arsenal saving circa 50k a week in wages by replacing fab and nas with arteta and benayoun.
I'm afraid cesc also has form for this kind of thing with the interview he gave to don balon magazine last season that sent arsenal mad
 Anyway, i agree with arsenal fans saying that what cesc did or didn't say only amounts to the truth in any case. 
 Expect arsenal team v blackburn to be: ws; bs, lk, pm, kg: as, ma: tw, aa, gerv; rvp. 
@SunSteveBrenner @JackWilshere the arsenal players chuck arshavin around in training all the time - nobody bats an eyelid
Wenger: Arsenal are back at the start ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/271865/Arsene-Wenger-going-back-to-basics …
 I'm at spurs tomorrow so i'm going to settle down to watch balckburn v arsenal and (not, ahem) watch villa v newcastle on t'internet 
I'll be amazed if arsenal don't piss this
This really is very comfortable for arsenal at the mo. Some might say they are 'pissing it'. Gerv could have had hat-trick already
And so a new arsenal inquest begins (sigh)....
 Think it will be v tight between arsenal, spurs and liverpool with all 3 dropping silly points 
Is it safe to assume arsenal fans were pissing about when they voted chamakh mom on website poll 4 blackburn game?
Wrote lots of Arsenal (quelle surprise) and Spurs today. See tomorrow's Express. Good night.
Also apologies to arsenal that my club villa gave bolton a confidence boost. I really wish we hadn't!
@ObumOsigwe I've literally never reported Arsenal fans are revolting against Wenger or club. You are a very strange man
I asked a good arsenal contact over the summer whether the club was seriously interested in joey barton...
 I was told 'arsenal have a very, very long list this year. Barton is probably on it but he'll be at the bottom.' 
William gallas unlikely to be fit to start for spurs v wigan on sat. More likely full return v arsenal on oct 2.
Just off to arsenal training ground - plan to avoid @charliewyett at all costs
 Left Arsenal. Wenger prickly in front of cameras but great with us. Lots of arsenal in paper tomoz, inc a bit of a 'special report' 
Back to real football. Predicted arsenal team v bolton coming up...
 Arsenal (4-3-3): ws; bs, lk, pm, as; ar, as, ma; tw, vp, gerv. 
 People like @MarkLawrenceafc need to realise that, apart from anything, it is better for my career if arsenal do well... 
 I like reporting on cl games, top of table matches etc and, being arsenal reporter, it helps if they are near top of table 
News of surgery for wilshere broke too late for some newspapers. Out until 2012 - terrible blow for him + arsenal
Should Arsenal have bought Gary Cahill? (full stats table on Cahill against Arsenal defenders only in the paper) ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/273349/Isn-t-Bolton-s-Gary-Cahill-worth-17m- …
Vp in arsenal programme reveals team had a bonding dinner on weds night and 'most the guys were dancing'.
Arsenal as expected - theo in for arshavin and gibbs in for santos from last week
Disjointed so far from arsenal. Still look the most likely though
100 arsenal goals for robin van persie. Nice one.
 Good performances for arsenal today from szczs, sagna, song, arteta, walcott and rvp. Ramsey good flashes 
How i would like to write. Brilliant piece by @PaulHayward_gnm on arsenal v bolton ://bit.ly/plpXGv 
Arsenal reliant on Robin (you'll like this if you like RVP) ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/273732/Arsenal-3-Bolton-0-Worried-Wenger-s-so-reliant-on-Robin-van-Persie …
Arsenal stat for u - in about 3300 mins since last august per mertesacker has one yellow card and no reds in club football #disciplined
 I was off yesterday but back today with arsenal champs league press conference - lots on agenda. Wilshere, rvp, oh yes and olympiakos 
Would arsenal fans prefer jack to come back in march and play last 10 games and go to euros. Or miss season and euros and return next term?
Arsenal fans should (could) find papers interesting tomorrow. No obvious story so should be lots of different articles....
It would be a lovely surprise if the guardian didn't break the arsenal quotes embargo (11pm) tonight.
Arshavin must be more than Arsenal's 20-minute man ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/274163/Arsenal-s-Andrey-Arshavin-must-show-cheeky-side-for-longer …
Arsenal need more from Arshavin ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/274163/Arsenal-s-Andrey-Arshavin-must-show-cheeky-side-for-longer …
@mattlittlechild but i'm flattered you obviously think so highly of journalists who cover arsenal
@mattlittlechild but i certianly don't and won't be using your 'handy' a-z guide for reporting on arsenal or any other club!
Nice one ox - read my report in tomorrow's express about arsenal's latest star. Night.
Oxlade-Chamberlain is the latest in Arsenal's 'one born every minute' series (plus Olympiakos match report) ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/274416/ …
 @daryl_photoshop i am a member of the media. It's like me thinking an arsenal players is rubbish, but saying the whole team is rubbish.. 
@JonnyOneill @SamRJHyde the intro has some journalistic licenece but i'm talking about arsenal giving teenagers a chance in the CL
@JonnyOneill @SamRJHyde think arsenal came of age in the CL quite some time ago!!!!
 @ladyarse @nealcol sorry, i'm as touchy as an arsenal fan today! 
@JonnyOneill if you meet him i absolutely guarantee you will see charlie has no agenda against arsenal and is actually quite pro-arsenal
@SamRJHyde @JonnyOneill arsenal and spurs both do well out of the press in general. Try being fulham - nobody gives a toss about them
Ade won't celebrate in front of Arsenal fans ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/274599/Emmanuel-Adebayor-I-am-just-so-sorry …
Arsenal's ox-factor Fresh Prince would relish Tottenham chance ://bit.ly/oSnCxn 
@HarlowGooner i never said a word about arsenal crowd apart from coming on here to say it was a good attendance so with respect - piss off!
 Off to arsenal for pre-tottenham press conf today. Lots to ask wenger about but, as always, open to (sensible) suggestions 
Arsenal are the only organisation for whom posting a profit is a pr disaster!!
 Hearing theo fit for arsenal today, still unsure if defo selected. 
Actually hearing walcott fit and starts for arsenal. Gerv less likely
 Spurs-Arsenal impressions. Spurs first (seeing as they won); parker excellent, dominated midfield. Team did well to go again after equaliser 
 Arsenal: sczesny brilliant but will be disappointed with walker goal, gerv disappointing, per not the best today and team tired badly 
Injury to sagna v worrying for arsenal too - no senior back-up at club. Jenko willing but not ready
Arsenal confirm sagna out for 3 months with fracturered fibula
My Tottenham-Arsenal match report ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/275183/Tottenham-2-Arsenal-1-Harry-Redknapp-s-heroes-a-sure-fire-bet …
 Neither set of spurs and arsenal fans covered themselves in glory yesterday so spare me the 'they were worse', 'no they were worse'. 
The most depressing thing for arsenal is they didn't actually play that badly yesterday - their squad just isn't strong enough...
 Current arsenal team - with sagna, verm, wilshere out - are no better than top 8 and a cup run. With full team still think poss top 4. 
Assured szczesny withdrawal from poland squad with bad back is purely precautionary #arsenal
Pat Rice goes mad at Arsenal players (don't know why a par has been repeated on website version) ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/275448/Angry-Rice-lays-into-Arsenal …
 Also done big inside arsenal piece on why people believe what they see, not what they hear. Not online yet for some reason. Will link later 
@this_is_skimps fortunately wasn't covering arsenal then (i was spurs man!) So i was very unobjective! #upthevilla
Seeing is believing for arsenal - time to face up to problems  ://bit.ly/ntyabv 
Pat rice goes mad at arsenal players ://bit.ly/qBJjwj 
 @Arsenal_DNA haha, thanks i think! 
Thanks for kind comments on arsenal piece - glad majority are seeing it is not criticising just for the sake of it.
Last time i link or RT this (promise). Why arsenal must face up to their  problems ://bit.ly/ntyabv 
@Arsenal_Ratings eh?
@Arsenal_Ratings ah - superb so far
@ObumOsigwe if you start tweeting arsenal that i should be banned then i'm going to block you.
 @jimmyjenkins @obumosigwe don't mind him having a go, which he does A LOT, just don't like him tweeting arsenal to ban me 
 @mikeymike2711 thought they were blinkered, which is part of my wider point about arsenal. Have no prob with jack, though 
@johnnie_jackson wrote a big arsenal piece. I'll send it you
In rare position of having to buy arsenal fan @RussJefferys lunch today because villa are higher in league. That's a nandos wenger owes me
Wilshere gives Arsenal some good news by promising to stay ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/275812/Jack-Wilshere-Nothing-could-tempt-me-to-leave-Arsenal …
@SamRJHyde @jonnyoneill and one got blocked cause he kept directly tweeting arsenal asking for me to be banned!
 Arsenal will attempt to open contract talks with RVP, Walcott and Verm next month with Richard Law in charge of negs..... 
Adebayor rated only 50/50 to be fit for Tottenham's trip to Newcastle this weekend. Picked up a hammy strain in win over Arsenal.
@timpayton why tim? Surely arsenal would benefit from negotiating their own overseas rights.
Tried to get this arsenal snippet in paper for 2 days now and it's been cut both times....
Thomas vermaelen has targetted arsenal's trip to chelsea on oct 29 for a return from injury. Club hopeful he'll make it.
On arsenal fans' forum tonight is @matt_barlow_dm - a must watch. Knows his bananas.
@johncrossmirror @darrenarsenal1 - i might have to ban arsenal chat at roses gig...!
Reliably told suggestions an arsenal player asked for medical advice at chelsea are nonsense
 Good for arsenal, good for my fantasy team. Bad for sunderland. 
Arsenal looking nervy now. Could have been 3 up b4 sunderland goal
Szczesny's too good for this arsenal team - almunia would fit in much better #getmanuelback
Arsenal pushing hard now. Need to score while on top.
Encouraging for arsenal today that rosicky played well and arshavin was an effective sub.
 Arsenal ratings: ws 7, cj 6, lk 6, pm 6, kg 5; as 7, ma 5: tw 5, tr 7, ger 7, rvp 9 
If i was arsenal i would not sell rvp even if he doesn't sign a new deal. He's worth more to them than the money they'd get for a 29 yr old
RVP to snub January interest and give Arsenal one last chance to prove their ambition ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/278163/Robin-Van-Persie-s-Arsenal-waiting-game …
Not on arsenal trip to marseille as the office are sending me to chelsea with @TonyBanksXP tomorrow night instead...
Probably for the best as i'd infect the entire arsenal squad with my killer cold if i was on a plane with them
 @OliverKayTimes i agree mate, man city offer better money and prospects than arsenal. An attractive package when put together 
@Grennan84 @OliverKayTimes which club will win more trophies over next 10 yrs (rest of nasri's career). City or arsenal?
Vermaelen signs new arsenal contract until 2015 - good news. Now just rvp and theo to go...
Never heard a player say 'the club is doing well financially' on signing a new contract before. Odd #arsenal #vermaelen
Not sure why people keep asking about song - as far as i know he is already contracted to arsenal until 2015.
Arsenal have no fit right-backs for Stoke and Chelsea games (Jenko likely to be out for two weeks) ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/278769/Johan-Djourou-s-right-man …
@Arsenal_DNA so u would feel quite confident if rvp had to miss a game?
 @Arsenal_DNA certianly kuyt and, yes, prob pav over chamakh now. Cham started well but has been terrible for nearly a year now 
@BobbyAFC79 not saying they are the best but stronger than arsenal's options after rvp
So back on the arsenal beat as of tomorrow morning. Things defo looking up. Issues to address but also points to feel positive about
Got lots of tweets from arsenal fans a couple of weeks ago saying 'wouldnt care if theo went'. Theo is v important to arsenal and rvp.
There was a welcome new addition at arsenal press conf today in @RorySmith_Indy - his wenger impression needs a lot of work though. A lot.
 To be fair, arsenal probably deserved a trophy for that alone! Rvp unlucky not to be in player list, but can't see him losing sleep over it 
This is my first live viewing of park. I have not viewed much from him so far #arsenal
Arsenal need to keep getting ball to walcott and gervinho. It will produce a goal.
Just writing my one-man team arsenal intro now.
 Impressions from Arsenal last night. Good: Vermaelen. Theo and Gerv caused lots of problems. Bad: Park (not ready for that standard), Santos 
Just watched some of the chelsea highlights in genk. David luiz is as bad as any of arsenal's bad defensive signings
 If luiz was at arsenal everybody would be laughing their heads off at him. A defender, who has a good touch but can't defend. Great. 
 For those accusing me of being an arsenal fan, i'm a villa fan (paul mcgrath and martin laursen v good, curtis davies, zat knight v bad) 
@MarkHealyAFC arsenal didnt need to win and they didnt score in any case!! Playing theo up top hardly a huge gamble
Wenger wants Arsenal to start work on keeping Walcott by offering big pay rise ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/281637/Arsene-Wenger-wants-to-woo-Theo-Walcott …
Just in case i was too early 1st time: Wenger wants Arsenal to start work on keeping Walcott by offering big pay rise ://bit.ly/uldbTp 
Think this is arteta's best arsenal performance
 Thought jenko was much better for arsenal today. But arteta was my star man - far more influence going forwards. Much, much better 
Didn't like arsenal's new club banners though. Tacky and un-arsenal-like. Get rid.
 Okay, okay, the arsenal banners were made and voted for by fans. Not so shit then but still tack (the batman and robin one) and a bit forced 
 You're right, i have nothing to complain about arsenal performance today. Nobody scored under a 7 and at least three eights in there 
 @official_alexp err, everybody pulls me up on everything i say. Non arsenal fans say i'm an arsenal fan and arsenal fans say i'm negative 
 Capello bonkers if he selects oxlade-chamberlain in full england squad. Great talent, but not ready and not even in arsenal squad now

 Busy, busy day. Written about yaya toure (v nice man), man city, wenger, arsenal and little bit of wilshere. Tired now. 
Wilshere was careful with his words last night but there is positivity inside Arsenal that his x-ray results could see him return earlier
Wrote a few pars on wilshere (cant find on web) saying arsenal hoping he can maker quicker recovery and return before march following xray
Fabregas: Arsenal must keep RvP ://bit.ly/vYjCly 
Must say cesc was v respectful of arsenal when a few of us spoke to him on saturday. Think his only beef is with hill-wood! #understandable
@GambossLives @cesc4official what? I was in the interview and cesc was v respectful of arsenal. Read the article again. Dear oh dear
Amazed arsenal fans taking issue with cesc - he said he is an arsenal fan and wants rvp to stay when i asked 'do u want him at barca?'
Arsenal set for Real row over Wilshere leak ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/283772/Arsenal-in-Real-battle-for-Jack-Wilshere …
@DannyBoyJones23 I don't think he's going anywhere. The story is Arsenal will be furious that Real are going down the Barca route
@JDTIPS If it was 'robbed from Marca' I would have simply written Madrid will try to sign Wilshere. Story is Arsenal furious with tactics
 Can I clear up I have not written an article saying Wilshere is going to Madrid, I have written Arsenal angry with underhand tactics of RM 
@SamRJHyde I've somehow upset them by taking Arsenal's side. Utterly bizarre.

Every answer provides a new question for Arsenal ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/285053/Norwich-1-Arsenal-2-Just-bombing-along …
1 point yet to be highlighted from arsenal win over norwich is i thought andre santos had his best game for the club. Sign of thing to come?
Szczesny was most amusing at arsenal today. You can tell wenger loves his joking around.
 Lots of arsenal in tomorrow's express. Some by me, some not by me and some by me written for other people's columns!! Toodle pip

@BeltransMole23 @JonnyOneill arsenal put rvp up to media for first time this season after 100th goal. So we asked about his future
@JonnyOneill @ladyarse i actually specifically wrote in my marseille match report it is unfair to brand arsenal a one man team....
@JonnyOneill @ladyarse the regulars at arsenal all want arsenal to do well. Makes our job easier and we like watching big games
@RayVerschoyle @JonnyOneill @ladyarse the future of all arsenal's players are linked to wenger.

@johncrossmirror what radio/tv/internet/carrier pigeon stations can I catch u on later. I need my fix of your views!! Enjoy arsenal
Feel like an ambulance chaser today - ditching arsenal to go and see chelsea v wolves. Expecting a narrow home win.
@JWTelegraph @johncrossmirror - arsenal press officers!
I leave arsenal for one day...
Double joy for @johnnie_jackson - charlton beat huddersfield to go further clear and arsenal record is safe. #arsenalsecretagent

 @ObumOsigwe happy birthday obum, I hope arsenal give you a wonderful birthday present tonight. 
It must be getting towards xmas - no abuse for predicting a city win. Maybe I'll tip arsenal to lose every week!
 Nasri not getting it too bad so far - I reckon arsenal fans still love him really. Go on, admit it... 
 Coquelin having a great game for arsenal, who are doing v well at the moment 
 Stand out arsenal performers for me tonight were oxo-cube, coquelin and koscielny

Spoke to a few olympiakos fans last night who all thought arsenal will win even with a 2nd team out. All picked out oxo-cube as main threat
Least surprising news Ive ever heard - robin van persie is arsenal's player of the month. In other news grass remains green and the sky blue
Add szczesny to the van persie list of arsenal players who aren't allowed to get injured.
 So, arsenal ratings.... Lf 4, vm 2, jd 3, ss 4, tv 5, as 5, I'm 6, ef 6, fc 5, aoc 6, yb 6, aa 5, mc 5. But yes they don't really matter 
My olympiakos v arsenal report ://bit.ly/swYDLT 
Santos injury worry for arsenal ://bit.ly/rH9MVq 
 Arsenal have no full-backs for Saturday, but Everton have no strikers. I wonder who is now number 2 keeper for arsenal? Almunia anybody? 
 As an 'outsider', I'm amazed at what relative low regard Ian wright is held in by arsenal fans. So what if he's critical? That's good imo 
 Oh no, ian wright once said something nice about spurs and he doesn't always say everyone at arsenal is a 'legend'. Do me a favour 
Glad to hear there are also a lot of sane arsenal fans out there who do appreciate what ian wright did for arsenal
 And to answer a few wright/arsenal questions. Dwight Yorke joined birmingham, let alone said nice things about them and I still love him 
Some yossi for arsenal and chelsea fans ://bit.ly/tFsxzy 
Off to sing happy birthday to Arsenal later. I hear @johncrossmirror has got his party hat ready and @charliewyett is bringing the cake
A big happy birthday to @johncrossmirror - spooky he shares his birthday with arsenal.
In today's express - henry says he'd like to manage arsenal one day and wenger says he will help him get coaching badges...
Happy birthday once again to arsenal and @johncrossmirror. Inseperable.
Van Persie can join the Arsenal legends club ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/289077/Henry-has-his-statue-now-Robin-Van-Persie-s-right-on-course-for-his …

 Spurs, arsenal, liverpool and chelsea will all have wobbles this season. The two who are least wobbly will get 3rd and 4th #wobblewobble 
 And, yes, arsenal, chelsea, spurs and liverpool have already had wobbles - and they will all have more. January t market could be telling 
@MuppetGooner they are also unbeaten in the league. Look forward to you telling me 'I told u so' when arsenal overtake them

I'm off today. Bad news for arsenal on santos but gibbs now getting closer to return. Another 'few weeks' that turned into a few months
 So a pretty negative reaction to the wayne bridge loan idea for arsenal. Obviously, they will just get ashley cole back or lahm #realworld 
 If you're not watching chelsea-city, call @johncrossmirror now on +44 (0)207 607 3200 and talk to him about guess what? Arsenal, of course! 
@J_Hinds_london @TheCoatHanger1 to be fair - I neither said bridge was some kind of genius or that arsenal should go for him. It was an idea
No clichy v arsenal then
*puts line through 'can city match your invincible team this season?' question for friday's Arsenal press conference *
Congrats to arsenal.com on winning sports website of year. Maybe a glass of champers to the journos whose mixed zone interviews they share?!
And the daily 'media watch' section of the site surely guarantees us a mince pie at the very least at the next arsenal press conference...
Richard Clarke must surely be in line to succeed Arsene Wenger as Arsenal boss after ending club's trophy drought with website of the year.
@JonnyOneill they probably nicked the arsenal chef too!

Up bright and early to see mr wenger. Looking forward to the mince pies and champers laid on for journos contribution to arsenal web award.
Well done to @simon_cassDM on reminding me on wenger denying interest in phil jones. That was most annoying. Arsenal are watching pod - fact

 To recap, arsenal and chelsea monitoring tube strike v carefully as it could mean posponement of their boxing day games. Decision next week 
@VinceHale story was given to me by arsenal and chelsea gave me a quote. That good enough for you? You make me laugh.
for late risers: Wenger sparks fear of more City sales (also Arsenal and Chelsea boxing day games could be off) ://bit.ly/s16W45 
 Been off today, but really hope that cock who was having a go at my arsenal tubes story on sat has seen the club statement. 
Decision on arsenal boxing day game v wolves prob made tomorrow but looking increasingly likely game will be delayed to the 27th
Chelsea not so sure when boxing day game would be replayed if postponed. Arsenal would be 24 hours on Dec 27.
Gibbs injury setback could mean wayne bridge loan for arsenal. More in tomorrow's Express
In today's express: Gibbs injury setback could mean wayne bridge loan for arsenal.
Arsenal will consider bridge loan option if they get bad news on gibbs (read down): ://bit.ly/sI5aAN 
@StockportRed he's talking specifically about tevez in that quote - really think bridge will be granted a loan if arsenal want to take him
 Chelsea Boxing Day game goes ahead, Arsenal decision by 5pm 
Seems arsenal now announcing decision on Boxing Day game tomorrow - waiting for TFL decision which they originally thought would be today
Can understand arsenal's decision to postpone boxing day game for 24 hours - tube strike would have made it a bit of a nightmare
 If you like arsenal and rvp, then get tomoz express. Tribute to his incredible year 
Arsenal manager wenger likely to be forced into loan market after gibbs confirmed out for 4 weeks. Wayne Bridge a real possibility.
Good soundbites from avb and rvp saying chelsea and arsenal still in title race. Load of bollocks though - 2-horse race between city and utd
Early for arsenal open training at the emirates so in the little wonder cafe - which actually is a little wonder.
Today @johncrossmirror has brought his new i-pad to arsenal - no sense out of him all day. I may stamp on it if he keeps going
Signing off for Christmas now. Back for arsenal-wolves. Merry Chrizzler x
I disagree with the opinion getting Arsenal in top 4 this season would be 1 of Wenger's best achievements. But it will be his best recovery

An honour to sit with celebrity arsenal reporter @johncrossmirror today #starstruck
I'll accept the thanks of all arsenal fans on behalf of aston villa #whoopwhoop
Arsenal player of 2011 has to be robin van persie but honourable mention should go to laurent koscielny who has proved a lot of us wrong.

I don't know this - but I just have a hunch van persie will start for arsenal again today
Such a strange 2nd half performance from arsenal but credit to fulham who showed great spirit and have some good players. I like ruiz
 Just watched the arsenal game again. Wenger's bonkers if he doesn't think djourou should have walked. Djourou was naïve, not the ref. 
I agree arsenal should have had a penalty but they also should have killed the game themselves in the 1st half. They ran out of steam
 @ObumOsigwe stuart atwell was far worse in wolves game, but, oh hang on that didn't affect arsenal did it? 
Stuart atwell was far worse in wolves game than Lee probert last night. Only difference atwell's decisions cost wolves and not arsenal.
Wenger's team selection and anger last night tells me he thought arsenal were in the title race had they won.
Wonder what arsenal would've said if barca announced signing of cesc before deal had been signed off or posted pic of him in a barca shirt?
Arsenal fans angry with me - but there can't have been a more blatant tapping up than this thierry henry loan deal. I just find it amusing
 Correct, red bulls are happy with it but they might not have been. Just think it's ironic given arsenal complaints on barca and man city 
@ArsenalFCView it's an opinion - just like my 700-word opinion last week on why spurs are still miles behind arsenal #antiarsenalmyarse
 Must say, spurs fans far more reasoned when I wrote 700-word opinion piece in paper on why arsenal are still ahead of them... 
I'm not an arsenal fan so it's prob only natural we won't agree on everything. But please don't abuse or start going on about 'anti-arsenal'
 @Miss__Arsenal nothing to explain. It's my opinion, which, apparently, I'm not allowed to express. 
@GoonerGossip see my reply to miss arsenal. Staggered an opinion can cause such outrage.
@Miss__Arsenal why are you now bullying people who have a different opinion to you?
@Miss__Arsenal they did. Song and RvP are on record as saying they tried to convince henry to sign....
 @Miss__Arsenal you can't call an opinion wrong, you can only disagree with it 
 @Miss__Arsenal said arsenal would have gone mad if same had happened with cesc, which they would. 
@Miss__Arsenal how do you decide which words you cap up?

@ArsenalFCView @miss__arsenal but you see players were on record on the issue? You asked me to show you.
@Miss__Arsenal yes. Every club does it. Just wish arsenal didn't pretend they dont
 @Miss__Arsenal stop using caps, please. It's tapping up if the players are telling them to join, not if they are discussing Eastenders 
@Miss__Arsenal that's fine - I think we'll have to agree to disagree which really isn't the end of the world
 @ArsenalFCView no, not at all. I really have no problem with people disagreeing just don't get abuse and anti-arsenal blah blah 
 @Miss__Arsenal don't worry, you're a pussycat in comparison to many on here. Enjoy the debate. 
@Miss__Arsenal sorry. I actually followed you by accident. Pressed the wrong button. I'll give you a one-day trial and then review decision

 A lot of the criticisms of united are the same as arsenal have faced for a while - lack of leaders, dodgy keepers, lack of signings, etc etc 
@UsmanWahabHabib @JamieDalton82 how do u expect transfer news when it takes arsenal a week to try to sign someone they've had for a month?!?

Henry arsenal deal initially runs to feb 16 with option to extend to feb 26 so he could make final farewell v tottenham

Other stuff - WBA to bid £4m for Peter Whittingham (Fulham interested too). McEachran to join Swansea on loan ahead of Arsenal match.
 Why are Arsenal fans still obsessed with Nasri? Forget him, he's an irrelevance. 
@Miss__Arsenal it's unsettling and not v classy - but not direct tapping up. Not having a big debate on this as we'll go round and round!
@Miss__Arsenal thanks Lord Sugar
@Miss__Arsenal do you like going round and round? You quoted 'FM12' to me - more dangerous than drugs that game is
@Miss__Arsenal will u get the hump if I ignore your tweets on this? Just finished work and looking to relax. Anything different to discuss?
@Miss__Arsenal busy thanks. And I was tired after last night. But it was a brilliant brilliant moment to witness
@Miss__Arsenal said it earlier - the pic of wenger and henry embracing will be the image of the season for me. Really felt pleased for weng
@Miss__Arsenal they will try v hard to keep him for that (that's why option is in the contract) and suspect henry will want it....
@Miss__Arsenal but it is ultimately the decision of red bulls and hard to call what they will think

@ArsenalPie you obviously don't actually read anything I write. Never said spurs are better than arsenal or tipped arsenal for relegation
 @RorySmithTimes totally agree mate - very impressed with him and think he'd be perfect for liv, arsenal or spurs 
Steven Fletcher being touted by @rorysmithtimes as good signing for liverpool. What about Arsenal? I think he'd be a v good choice.
@johnnie_jackson steven fletcher - would you have him at arsenal? V good and underrated striker in my opinion.
I was told on thursday that henry has 30 minutes in him. Starts a sub today - wonder if arsenal will need all 30 minutes?
Brendan Rodgers doing super job at swansea - really good team to watch. Injuries caught up with Arsenal. Trying to muddle through too risky
@toongooner @johncrossmirror you're wrong - fletcher is also better than anything arsenal have in reserve up front. V underrated
@DarrenArsenal1 wenger is still comfortably the best performer of all in a management role at arsenal. If he goes it gets worse b4 better

 @JamieDalton82 there is a book called 'the tipping point', which, if related to arsenal now, makes an awful lot of sense

 Been getting loads of questions about various arsenal rumours today. I've had a day off, so no idea! Read the papers. 
Arsenal waiting on results of a scan to find out whether Wilshere has suffered a serious injury setback. Hopefully Wenger will tell more
@johnnie_jackson haha - doubt it. Will be tense if arsenal start slowly though

 @ARSENALDvbrisG I report on arsenal. Never see my criticise any other club? What about the one I support, villa?

@Official_Henri good thanks - helped that arsenal won a game! How are things with @thebig_sam ?
 If I was a sunderland fan, I would see tonight's game as bigger than last week's against Arsenal and yet most of them have stayed at home 
Did Arsenal really reward Johan Djourou with a new contract recently? It's like walking out your house and putting money down the drain.
@MartinHolleran but at arsenal a 4th choice centre back has to play at least 30 games. He's not up to it.
@Brett_leverton not really the point - unless you want Arsenal to go the same way as villa. Which is a bad way!

Mixed reaction to this one: How Arsenal are making the Tottenham mistakes of old ://bit.ly/wuybYr 
And according to Van Persie it's ONLY about Arsenal Football Club - so much so he can't sign a new contract. Err...
Stan Kroenke not at the Emirates today. Decided against watching Arsenal-Spurs in the end. He has sent a personal good luck message to team
Hear Walcott defo plays for Arsenal today so either Ox or Gerv on the bench?
So no Ox or Gerv starting for Arsenal today. Hmmm.
The man dressed as robin from batman shouldn't have been let in #arsenal
Arsenal 'fan' near me shouting 'snap him' every time Bale gets the ball.
Wenger's put his big coat on and arsenal have woken up a bit. This game still wide open.
Mental game. Arsenal proudly displaying their bollocks.
I told you Arsenal would win 5-2.

 @TheRealGunner @1Walid voicing frustration is much different to openly abusing a player, which some arsenal fans openly do to walcott 
@TheRealGunner @1Walid I'd argue eboue was only turned into a cult hero because arsenal fans were ashamed of those who used to boo him
LOVE the fact Arsenal announced their profits today. I bet any money it would have been weds (day of england game) if they had lost v spurs
Busy busy day on england and arsenal.
@JamieDalton82 @johncrossmirror why are Arsenal fans obsessed with Gareth Bale? It reminds me how Spurs fans used to be about Arsenal stars

I think szczesny has had a dodgy couple of months but he's kept arsenal in this so far. Midfield needs to wake up
Another brilliant save. Think szczesny's found his form again. arsenal drawing but generally awful so far
 This game should already be over. Liverpool v good and much the quicker, arsenal terrible but szczesny brilliant and van persie clinical 
Such a big 6 points for Arsenal. Showed real character in both games as well.
@Arsenal_RTs x
Off to Arsenal tonight. Have I ever been to a more pointless game? Probably not. I don't believe in miracles.

Ive got an arsenal offer; Meet @johncrossmirror enjoy ben and jerrys and go to mixed zone with him at AC Milan dead rubber for free plus VAT
@wrecker19 @johncrossmirror 3 reasons I don't have faith. 1. I'm not an arsenal fan. 2. I don't believe in miracles. And 3. I am not insane.
This is an incredible effort by arsenal so far. Whatever happens from here they can be proud
Wonderful effort from arsenal - they go out with their heads held high
 @bazza_wicks I have a limited number of words. Our back page is on the ref, my report rightly gives arsenal credit. 
Arsenal fans would erupt if gael clichy or cesc fabregas was texting RvP about going to City or Barca. Just saying like.
 @johncrossmirror c'mon, I know you're still excited from last night but do stop trying to be arsenal's official cheerleader #pompoms

@SuperCoolEskimo he is the official arsenal columnist - the subject of his column this week is arsenal. Stop bveing disrespectful
 @SuperCoolEskimo ha ha, I mean official Express columnist. Should make him official Arsenal columnist though just to annoy you! 
@DRServen it's my job to report on Arsenal.
Arsenal wise to get Pod agreed before euros. The fear was that a good euros would attract bigger bids. A rare well done from me 2 Ivan Gazza
Podolski turns down 40m anzhi offer in favour of arsenal ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/306998/Lukas-Podolski-My-40m-sacrifice- …

Things I get accused of most regularly on here: 1. Being anti-Arsenal. 2. Being an Arsenal fan. Truth is I'm neither.

@paulleat decisions in last two years in particular have been terrible. Even small things like loaning yossi to arsenal.
Off down the road for Tottenham press conference. Assuming if I ask Redknapp 'are u worried about Arsenal' he won't reply 'yeah bricking it'
The man who used to sell 'Arsenal toilet roll' outside White Hart Lane isn't here any more
@christoronyi @MarkG_Arsenal me and Mr G. What fun! Can I still be critical?!?!
Wenger prays to see Muamba's smile - and Arsenal scout M'Vila (again) ://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/309284/Arsene-Wenger-We-pray-to-see-his-smile …
No Arsenal pre-Everton press conference so off to Tottenham pre-Stoke today. Tough job 4 Redknapp to get all players in right frame of mind
From earlier: Wenger prays to see Muamba's smile - and Arsenal scout M'Vila (again) ://bit.ly/GACUZ6 
I also don't hope arsenal finish third or hope chelsea finish in top four. Will be exciting to see who finishes where they deserve to
 I wasn't at Arsenal today (day off). But why does anyone, ever bother asking Wenger about transfers? By his own admission he just lies! 
   @christoronyi: Wanna know what @MattLawExpress thinks of ArsenalvVilla game? Listen to Arsenal America Podcast.   I think we'll get thumped. 
@ayofxx @MikelArteta08 read it before slagging - lots of valuable arsenal info in there and not said rvp wants to leave or will leave
@Bosscielny on my behalf?! Can't arsenal at least stuff villa on your behalf?! I don't want to be responsible for it.
 @Arsenal_RTs well said, thanks 
Gotze signs new Dortmund contract. Arsenal will have to pay top dollar if they want him
 @TomJMW haha, think the new contract was an insurance policy for Arsenal but I grant you it was a very odd one!!!

 Great turn and finish by taarabt - wakey, wakey Arsenal. They look as bright as I feel #notvery 
Calm finish by Walcott on rebound after he hits post. QPR 1 Arsenal 1
Can see why all those Arsenal fans wanted Wenger to sign Taye Taiwo in January #not
Can't tell if Vermaelen slipped or was out muscled but Mackie did well to set up Diakite to put QPR 2 - 1 up over Arsenal
No surprise Ramsey subbed for Arsenal. Done very little today. Gervinho on.
 Did say it would be tough for Arsenal at QPR today. Great, spirited performance by QPR and deserved win 
Arsenal winning run ends but just need to pick it up again v Man City next week
Bit disappointed Arsenal players only did in-house media today. They've rightly had lots of praise over 7-game winning run #2waystreet

@arseblog @shewore @drumgiant @goonertalk I must say I think some of the Arsenal blogs are the best around and I've said so on radio before
@SheWore @arseblog @drumgiant @goonertalk haha I remember that story - arsenal were really annoyed by it!

 Can I assume Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool fans would all take Dempsey? 
 So, generally, the fans from Arsenal, Tottenham, Chelsea and Liverpool, they say yes to Dempsey. And Man Utd fans seem to like him too. 
Off to Arsenal-City today. City been v negative on last few visits to Emirates but surely have to go on front foot today. Could suit Arsenal
Arsenal were excellent today. It wouldn't have flattered them to have won 3-0.

@shaunkrish that's exactly the problem. No foresight from chelsea. Agree yossi not set world alight for arsenal but been key in big wins
@shaunkrish but he has made a difference to Arsenal's cause. Why let a chelsea player help a rival for free? Doesn't make sense
Yossi Benayoun helps Arsenal pull further away from Chelsea. You know my views.
@DarrenArsenal1 if Arsenal were winning 3-0 would u mind rvp scoring an own goal to make it 18 teams?
Loved Van Persie's penalty but it must be put on record that he stole the idea from Dwight Yorke. Even remeber Yorke doing it v Arsenal
No Arsenal for me tonight. I've decamped to Chelsea lately - lots of Barca fun this week.
 @jonsarno michael, I assume you want Arsenal to draw level to help the biggest club and ambassadors of midlands football? 
Is it rude to beep arsenal players when they pull over in their cars to sign autographs on the way out of training?

Back at Arsenal today - big selection call from Di Matteo. Interesting to see how Oxlade-Chamberlain gets on
 I see why Arsenal and their fans are v protective of Wilshere but if he's physically fit in time, then he should play in the Olympics IMO. 
Off to spurs-blackburn later. Wonder if the arsenal toilet roll man is a) still in buisness and b) brave enough to face the elements...?
Seems the arsenal toilet roll man gets around - I assumed he was a spurs fan but there were sightings of him at Chelsea-Barcelona...
Arsenal toilet roll man not at White Hart Lane today - must have opted for Stamford Bridge.
 So cologne confirm podolski's arsenal move? Yawn, we've all known that for months. V good signing tho 
RT @arsenal: Tom Watt and John Cross on the Fans' Forum are discussing their ideal midfield three for next season. Who would you play?
Really hope @johncrossmirror has sorted the big issue of the night and picked arsenal's perfect midfield 3 for the fans' forum

Everyone connected with Arsenal needs to chill out. Everything feels v nervy around the Emirates. Norwich playing well.
 Don't worry Arsenal fans, Tottenham have to go to (ahem) fortress Villa Park tomorrow. Champions League in the bag. 
Arsenal v  v lucky. Def penalty when Coquelin takes out Hoolahan and could have been pen when Koscielny pulls Martin's shirt.
That should have been a pen for Arsenal. Naughton pushed Van Persie
It's become tradition that things go wrong on Arsenal lap of honour day.
Why does Arsenal's new kit look like an old Manchester United kit?
 Disappointed no Arsenal players would speak today but Ivan Gazidis was very polite and pleasant, despite the fact I've been a critic. Kudos 
@MarkG_Arsenal great vid and great song choice. Who at arsenal is a fan of @theriflesband ?

@johncrossmirror frivolous appeal - Henry should have 50 more goals taken off. Should we appeal that Arsenal r awarded 38 wins this season?!
@chrislepkowski @davidlawtennis I wasn't looking to make an issue of this. If Arsenal are not more motivated than WBA then something wrong
Incredible achievement for Arsenal to finish third after their start to season. Gives them a great chance to strengthen which must be taken
Ox has done well for Arsenal when he has played but it's largely promise and he is still extremely naive. Let him develop and play Olympics.
@KingyGooner still arsenal but also a wider brief.
Following slight web glitch - no amount of money can keep RvP at Arsenal if they don't show real ambition ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/exclusive-arsenal-fear-robin-van-848793 …
 @artfuljobber can't talk to press about arsenal contract, as it says in article. New interview 
@DarrenArsenal1 @philmcnulty pretty sure Arteta's contract will have contained a renegotiation clause if Arsenal got CL football
Fair play to Ivan G (regulate) 4 fronting up to Arsenal fans. He may not have been mega revealing but at least he's giving time and respect
Final word on this: All the Arsenal fans I know would love Redknapp to leave Tottenham because they think it would make them weaker.
Arsenal doing what they should have done last season and chasing/signing targets regardless of RvP....
 Things I have written about. Tottenham, Arsenal, Chelsea, Sunderland, England. Sunday Mirror. 
 @DanSilverMirror big ones tottenham manager, tottenham general overview, arsenal, england. 
What M'Vila said on Monday after England-France when ut Arsenal ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-target-yann-mvila-has-admitted-887137 …
Arsenal fans may have missed this but in one of my Tottenham articles today it states that Spurs have tried twice to pinch Steve Rowley
@MartinLipton @rickyrusby @garythegooner56 should add steve stammers' arsenal sources are extremely good.
Probably does Arsenal a favour that Holland are out in terms of RvP's future *should* be confirmed a bit quicker.
 Good business by Arsenal to get Podolski and Giroud. But if they sell Van Persie, the squad will be weaker - not stronger or even the same. 
Chelsea and PSG to test Arsenal resolve to keep Walcott ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/theo-walcott-in-demand-chelsea-and-psg-946788 …
@ObumOsigwe @johncrossmirror @arsenal steve works for the Sunday mirror and Crossy has written that man city need to sell b4 buying RvP.
 @ObumOsigwe @johncrossmirror @arsenal Obum, you are a very strange man. 
Chelsea and PSG to test Arsenal's resolve to keep Walcott. Some at club want to sell ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/theo-walcott-in-demand-chelsea-and-psg-946788 …
Any Arsenal fans who have abused me over my Ledley King opinion have also abused Thierry Henry because he agrees with me. So there.
So RVP says he wants to win trophies and doesn't agree with direction of Arsenal. He also says he will not sign a new contract. #time2sell
I got a right kicking from Arsenal fans over this story but it seems it was true ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/exclusive-arsenal-fear-robin-van-848793 …
 Given Van Persie's statement, I believe Arsenal should sell as quickly as possible - even if it's to Manchester City 
I think Van Persie has been advised terribly by his agent Kees Vos to release this statement. Very disrespectful to Arsenal.
Arsenal driving spec they are looking 4 RVP's replacement RT @arsenal Find out which 3 strikers Arsenal have been linked with in Media Watch
In case you missed it Arsenal Player of the Year Marton Fulop is set to join Asteras Tripolis in Greece. Via @chrislepkowski

 @arsenalsean66 sorry, wrong reply! Barca want to sell afellay and some in arsenal think he'd be a good signing. Unsure on rvp 
 @SportsPRCompany I know arsenal don't win many trophies, but that is really clutching at straws! 
Looks like Man City have tabled a bid in time to stop RvP going on Arsenal tour. Unsure on reports of Juve and Utd bids but v real interest.
 With bids now coming in for RvP, Arsenal are right to leave him in England and try to get the whole situation sorted out asap. 
@kdave_arsenal @bbcsport_david I didn't doubt david's info but said City bid is the only one I defo know about.
Take Juve out of the equation and there is an argument that Arsenal would be better to sell RvP to City than Utd...
 Realistically, Arsenal already can't compete with City but are not too far off Utd both on pitch and financially. So why strengthen Utd? 
 Just my opinion that currently United are possibly catchable for Arsenal, whereas City probably arent so worse to sell star player to United 
I am going to insult everyone's intelligence now by claiming my last tweets were in no way connected to Arsenal or RVP. Just a general point
@JonnyOneill @northbanklower @timpayton sure whatever wenger/arsenal said/did on this would provoke opinion.
Wanna listen to me talking to @georgiebingham about RVP/Arsenal/ManchesterUtd/Spurs/Villa and Alan Hutton? ://www.talksport.co.uk/radio/transfer-talk-show/120721/law-wenger-will-spend-rvp-money-attacking-midfielder-177101 …?
And read Steve Stammers on Bendtner's future and Arsenal's Cazorla bid ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-nicklas-bendtner-1153099 …
My colleague Steve Stammers today reports AC Milan and Galatasaray in for 7.5m-rated Bendtner and Arsenal have made a bid for Santi Cazorla
@BumperGraham problem is Arsenal will bid about 10p and then moan when utd/city/juve won't pay 30m for rvp.
Most journalists who cover Arsenal and a lot of Arsenal fans already have an automatic Wenger decoder for his little messages and meanings.
@simon_cassDM and Arsenal will bid 10p!
 @JamieDalton82 his m'vila quote is the hardest to decode. His reasoning doesn't make sense, as Arsenal had all those midfielders when... 
Good to see Koscielny rewarded for a very good second season at Arsenal. Out-performed Vermaelen last term and 2nd only to RvP...
@Arsenal Robin van Persie?
Although I hear Arsenal's pre-season tour to Asia has been very good!
I tell a lie - I covered Cologne v Arsenal last year. And that was meaningless rubbish. Hadn't done one for ages before that
 @Matt_Barlow_DM thanks, enjoy Arsenal v FC Kitchen. 
Southampton make shock Walcott enquiry but Arsenal hope to keep him. Cazorla and Sahin news too ://www.mirror.co.uk/incoming/southampton-bid-to-bring-theo-walcott-1180296 …
Southampton make shock Walcott enquiry but Arsenal to resume contract talks. Cazorla and Sahin news too ://www.mirror.co.uk/incoming/southampton-bid-to-bring-theo-walcott-1180296 …
Ridiculous in my opinion that Arsenal may have to arrange another friendly as team not properly prepared for new season...
Levy in danger of making same mistake on Modric as Arsenal did with Cesc if he let's this go on much longer. It's leaving the squad in limbo
Spoken to a few football people this week who are amazed Arsenal have pulled off the Cazorla deal without him being nicked by a rival club
Wonder what RvP is thinking? Put out statement and still hasn't left while in meantime Arsenal pull off a serious coup. He looks a bit silly
 Realise football not the first thing on people's minds but I've written about Arsenal, Tottenham, Man City and Chelsea in the Sunday Mirror 
Barca will bid for Song but Arsenal want to keep him and are set to announce Cazorla early this week and tie up Sahin ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/bacelona-set-for-15m-move-for-arsenal-1219092 …

 Back in the game. Well, back in the country at least. Back working from tomorrow at Arsenal v Sunderland. Love first day of football season 
I'm at Arsenal-Sunderland today. So much depends on how quickly foreign imports settle for Arsenal this season. Must hit ground running.
@simon_cassDM @johncrossmirror morning cass and cross. Song only good business if Arsenal buy in a better replacement. Otherwise stupid deal
@johncrossmirror great move if Arsenal are a bank. Otherwise not a great move until a replacement signed. See u later for more Songaldinho x
Diaby has started well for Arsenal today. Will be a huge plus if he can stay injury free

 @johncrossmirror @timpayton yep, also a v good point. S'pose all depends who Arsenal now bring in. 
@Arsenal_RTs yes. Massively
Will b interesting to see Sahin at Arsenal. Huge talent at Dortmund but barely played for Madrid. Wenger disappointed with creativity on Sat
It may be 1 out 1 in at Arsenal but Sahin not a like for like replacement for Song. More similar to Wilshere.
Good luck to Alex Song at Barca. Shame the way it ended at Arsenal as I found him polite and he seemed to genuinely love Arsenal and Wenger
 Moyes - works on budget, survives selling best players, spots a bargain, brings through youth and overachieves. Err, that's Arsenal job spec 
Lots of talk about Arsenal and defensive midfielders since Song exit. I'm not sure Wenger likes the premise of a 'defensive midfielder'..
@Soupy_Arsenal they love Leandro Damaio but he may prove too expensive
Arsenal's reluctance to agree permanent deal for sahin after loan suggests they are far from sure about him. So why try to sign him at all?
@AlCapone52 my info is different to other info but how do you know I'm wrong? I've heard Arsenal don't want to commit to permanent agreement
 Whether Sahin goes to Liverpool or Arsenal, my info has always been that Wenger has never been 100 per cent convinced about the deal. 
@ObumOsigwe I think Arsenal fourth and Villa 13th.
@ObumOsigwe tipped Arsenal for FA Cup too
@stewiemassey I tweeted that last Monday when the Arsenal move looked on. Obviously things changed you tool.
@Redmanmike that was tweeted on Monday when move to Arsenal was on. Things change.
This time last year I called Arsenal and Ivan Gazza useless for holding out too long on cesc and nasri and not getting in replacements first
@knoller2 no. I tweeted last week I'd be interested to see him play for them. He was v close to joining arsenal but good lfc signing now
Arsenal to make ambitious bid for Tiote and Yanga-Mbiwa ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-plan-15m-raid-for-newcastle-1279386 …
My bet is Walcott left out because not signed a new contract yet and Arsenal playing hard-ball. Risky move if I'm right.
Surprised Stoke didn't come out the blocks a bit quicker but that could be because Arsenal and Diaby dealing v well with their threat so far
@northbanklower @timpayton @darrenarsenal1 fully expect bid to be made on tiote but would be quite surprised if Arsenal met asking price
A song for Theo - maybe Cape Cod is code for Arsenal ://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abNc1gLig3s&feature=youtube_gdata_player …
@johncrossmirror what is arsenal's squad strong enough for though? To finish top 4 - probably. To win something - probably not.
 Moutinho would be perfect for Arsenal, as well as Tottenham. 
 Arsenal have done quite well, despite frustration at not getting a DM. Cazorla a super signing. Despite Berba I worry for Fulham 
Arsenal face new battle over Walcott with five clubs (including City and Liverpool) waiting to make January move ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-juventus-and-inter-1296157 …
Are Arsenal playing in purple today? I actually quite like it.
This may have got a bit lost on Sunday and only got tagged on bottom of my Walcott story but Arsenal working on new deals for Sagna + Gibbs
Arsenal have set an internal rule that anybody in final two years must be signed up - or risk being sold. No problem on Sagna or Gibbs
I reckon tough games for Arsenal and Tottenham this weekend which means they will both win 10-0
@Gingers4Limpar @arsenal andre santos?
@philmcnulty great point by an arsenal fan - so on that basis do you stick with mannone over szczesny after 3 clean sheets? Not for me.
Also hope Giroud gets off the mark for Arsenal tonight.
Good win for Arsenal. Any win away from home in Europe is a v good result.
 @johncrossmirror c'mon then who's your top 4? Mine is city, utd, chelsea, arsenal. Spurs 6th 
Want me to jinx your club? Ok I will...I fancy Arsenal to get a result at Manchester City and I also think Liverpool will beat United.
Chelsea not the best today but a win's a win. Will need to be far better against Arsenal next week. Need the 'good' Torres to turn up.

Thought Arsenal were the better team today. Very encouraging for them. City don't look quite right at the moment.
@kdjwilson I said Arsenal to get a result at City so I'm claiming one out of two.
 Saying that, I am a massive fan of Walcott and I think he's been harshly treated by Arsenal and Wenger. They'll miss him if he goes. 
Apologies to @johncrossmirror but I've done my web column on Arsenal this week. I'll link it when it goes 'live'.
 Arsenal's fans are pleasantly merry, but now they want to get smashed. Beers on Wenger? ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-accounts-could-reveal-arsene-1342840 …

@Sanks_Arsenal thanks v much
 Arsenal saying sell-out expected for Cov game tonight. Even if it's not quite the 60,000 they always claim, still very impressive support. 
Strange how Arsenal fans annually embrace League Cup and chance to watch youngsters while other fans get annoyed by it and stay away.
 @MattHughesTimes ha, I like the guy I retweeted who said all the city and utd fans go to Arsenal League Cup games to see their future stars. 
Realise this is odd but aerial view of the Ryder Cup fairways remind me of the old JVC yellow diamond Arsenal away kit. #obsurelookalikes
Boos of Arsenal fans for JT drowned out by a pin dropping - they were that loud. #quietbooing
Terry at fault for that Arsenal equaliser.

 It's been confirmed that Jack Wilshere is in the Arsenal squad that travels to Norwich tomorrow. Wonderful news for him, Arsenal and England 
Arsenal AGM next week could be tasty.
 My interview with Lewis Holtby, nicknamed 'Fritz' by his dad, who chose Germany but comes to England to face Arsenal ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-v-schalke-preview-lewis-1389594 … 
 Afellay was offered to Arsenal in the summer and they had a little think about it, so interesting how he does tonight 
Afellay makes his point after being politely turned down by Arsenal.
Arsenal no shots on target. Now you know how it felt every week for Villa fans with McLeish.
Does any other football club's AGM get the coverage Arsenal's does? Most AGM's pass without any comment or anybody taking any notice.
 Other than PHW being rude, two things really jumped out at me from the excellent @johncrossmirror and @garyjacob arsenal agm tweets... 
Oh sorry Wenger meant qualifying for the CL is a metaphorical trophy. Are Arsenal going to claim metaphorical victories and signings soon?
For all Arsenal criticism/controversy/problems highlighted over past week I'd still put 50 quid on them finishing in the top four #trophy
Santos half-time shirt swap highlights too many people at Arsenal just happy to be allowed to mix with the big boys #footballfwwwiieends

@kumbdotcom I also do not condone any verbal abuse to anyone - whether it is from West Ham or Arsenal fans.
 @kumbdotcom maybe that's because I didn't write a Man U, arsenal match report - I was on holiday at the weekend. Keep punching, though. 
 @Fantonidy Dont know if Pep will do better job, but Arsenal will have to take a risk if they want to change anything. Thanks 4 feedback 
@johncrossmirror @piersmorgan why can't arsenal finish fourth and win the FA or Carling Cup? Why does it have to be top four or a trophy?
Theo Walcott has been voted Arsenal's Player of the Month. He has started 1 game in that time. Message to Wenger and the board?
@StuartMawhinney fa website gives headline coverage to walcott plea to play for Arsenal....
@StuartMawhinney ...It seems we're not that different. I assume website feel Walcott on Arsenal is more interesting than Hope Powell
 @johncrossmirror Santos, Djourou, Arshavin, Chamakh, Squillaci, Park - Arsenal full of leaders and winning characters. Tsk. 
Arsenal-Fulham pour moi today - fancy a close game. I thought the same ahead of Arsenal-Southampton #thejudge
 @johncrossmirror stunning attack on wenger - you're so anti-arsenal, anti-wenger, anti-avb, anti-liverpool, anti, anti, anti 
Arsenal were strolling but not now. Sagna not be too good since return from injury. Berba lost him at corner
 @DarrenArsenal1 @JNorthcroft @timpayton on the subject of the keeper, remember when Arsenal wouldn't pay 1m more for schwarzer? 
@TheAFCMovement he is taking part in movember! Don't read my arsenal piece if you're a sensitive fan!

North London derby for me today. I'm no tactical wizard but if I was avb I'd be starting Bale on the right today. Fancy an Arsenal win
@Bentleysbird sorry - you not there? Wonder who bentley supports today - I think arsenal
Not a great day for the old-boys. Podolski shot deflects off Gallas and creeps past Lloris. Arsenal 2-1
Surely Arsenal will get 3 or 4 now. 10-man Spurs look there for the taking.
 I'll post Arsenal match report, ratings etc when on site. Had felt sorry for avb on Ade but he doesn't do himself any favours... 
 Loads in Sunday Mirror from me tomorrow. Arsenal, Tottenham, England, Reading, QPR and an interview with the Fox in the Box.

Villa-Arsenal for me tomorrow. Expecting a big home win.
Love the Stan Petrov support - well respected by Arsenal fans as well. Class
 Odd Arsenal performance. One shot on target is woeful for them. Podolski is talented but so, so lazy. Ox quiet too but sure he'll come good 
 ...From me: Chelsea, Guardiola, QPR, Beckham, bit of Arsenal and exclusive interviews with Joe Allen and Leon Britton. 
My Villa v Arsenal report ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/aston-villa-0-0-arsenal-match-1292061 …
 @duncanross10 as always, yes. Arsenal fans chanting at Wenger rather overshadowed other 'issues'. 
 Impressed by Lowton and Westwood again, who were good v Arsenal too. Guzan decent as well. Bannan needs to learn how to keep the ball. 
Theo Walcott should release his own calendar posing each month in the shirt of a club who would pay him more than Arsenal.
@Arsenal_Realist I haven't run a story about anything
I assume Wenger and Gazidis take a pay cut then if Arsenal finish outside the top four?
 Will take that point for Villa, spesh with saints losing. Not actually that shocked by Arsenal result. 
@Arsenal_Ant thanks
City clearly the better game tonight but I'm oddly drawn to the arsenal match. Looks like a night of channel hopping.
Ramsey been getting a fair amount of stick from Arsenal fans. He's been having a bad time but at least he keeps showing and putting it in..
@JonnyOneill @block6gooner I actually think Arsenal are right on Sagna. He was superb but been v average this season.
 Apologies I won't be linking anything tomoz morn. I'm assuming I'll be hungover. Manc derby, arsenal, chelsea, spurs and west ham in paper

 @JohnDillonExprs against a league two club. Ffs, this is awful from arsenal. 
 Whatever happens now this has been absolutely shit from arsenal. Shit, I tell you. 
 @JohnDillonExprs john, I agree on wilshere but how far have arsenal fallen? This is ridiculous. 
I remember arsenal coming to villa and I was grateful to watch them. The fact arsenal fans accept this is depressing.
@SandraHelena39 I find it sad. I know how u feel sandra but not all arsenal fans accept it
I'm not drunk and I'm not anti-arsenal. Wenger should go.
@MattHughesTimes this summer guardiola and mourinho will be available. Arsenal should be brave
@MattHughesTimes so wenger is the only man who can manage arsenal? Rubbish. He's living on past glory. He's not moved with the times.
Arsenal is bigger than Arsene Wenger.
Not going to wind up Arsenal fans and bang on about it all day but I stand by my opinion of last night. All other opinions are allowed.
Lots of fascinating Arsenal insight to read this morning. Papers leading the way.
Look out for Arsenal pieces by @johncrossmirror @charliewyett @jwtelegraph and @neilashton_
Fair play to Ivan Gazidis for holding his Arsenal supporters' xmas drinks bash last night - can't have been a hugely comfortable experience!
@brismy8 it was aimed at an arsenal supporting mate - I prob should have texted him rather than tweeting it to all! Apologies
 @GNev2 yeah, agree that was a mad thing to say. Will Arsenal ever win another trophy with Wenger would be a more interesting debate.

It's got to be an Arsenal win tonight. Hasn't it?
Arsenal exploiting time and space well but Reading all over the place.
This is surely now Arsenal's first-choice front three. Much better team selection tonight and it's paid dividends.
Arsenal could have scored 10
In the absence of @johncrossmirror I have done my web column on Arsenal and more specifically Jack Wilshere. I'll link when it goes live

@Denster85 eh? I wrote arsenal for Adrian Lopez last week. Never said Arsenal for Ba. Just repeated what Weng said on Ba.
 @Denster85 no, I said wenger didn't rule it out. There is clearly interest but I think Arsenal will buy elsewhere... 
 @Denster85 as for tiote, again there was interest but newcastle asking price put Arsenal off. 
@ShaneOmac85 arsenal and man Utd will both bid - that's all I know
 So Villa, Spurs, Utd and Arsenal victories would make it a good start to 2013 - would be even better if wba could make a comeback 
Early Arsenal presser today. Then it's club's festive fun day. I won't hang around for that but it's a great event Arsenal put on for fans.
Good insight in tomorrow's paper from Wenger on the fact he sets the contract and wage structure at Arsenal and why he does it.
@Swinestar96 @Stuart_PhotoAFC eh? My arsenal piece is interview with quotes from Wenger on Arsenal's wage structure from a press conference

 This is new - usually Arsenal fans having a pop at me on Sunday mornings, but today it's Villa. Not my fault the club made bad decisions. 
 @Mikhaels_ @TotallyArsenal @arseblog a few points - when asked if he controls the Arsenal wages, wenger's reply was 'yes'. 
Really think Arsenal will win today
 Circumstances of draw annoying for Arsenal, but a draw at Swansea is a very decent result these days. 
 The ticket price issue is not an Arsenal issue, it's a football issue. The categorisation of tickets is, in my opinion, completely wrong. 
@MartinLipton last two nights guardian have posted Arsenal press conference copy before 10pm. Embargo is 10.30 and always has been
 Walcott saga to end with £100k deal - but only for 18 months, which is worrying Arsenal. Wenger drops Cesc hint. #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-hold-fears-over-the-length-1531199 … 
Vermaelen has gone from being one of the best central defenders in Europe to being a liability for Arsenal. Linked with taking captaincy?
 Thought Milner was superb, much better from Arsenal in second half but too late. City were strong. 
@DarrenArsenal1 the 3-and-a-half-year part not great for arsenal - have to renegotiate in 18 months!
Important Arsenal signed Walcott up and that in itself a positive but 3.5 year deal is hardly a big success for the club.
 Had Arsenal got this done in the summer, Walcott would be on a longer contract and, most probably, less money. 
@johncrossmirror @talksportdrive @mattholland8 can they play the daily arsenal music with the little trumpet just before you go on?
@ArsenalFCView @clockenders a club offering Wenger £10m a year to leave Arsenal is a story.
@official_alexp I also didn't comment on Arsenal prices #consistency
Wonder if Arsenal inserted a clause into Chamakh's West Ham loan insisting he MUST play against them on Weds...?
 Ok, so we are allowed to name names. Seeing as Wenger said he wants two players, who do Arsenal fans (realistically) want? 
 David Villa, Diame and Wanyama getting a lot of love so far from Arsenal fans. Any shouts from the left field? 
 Quick scan through all the replies tells me Arsenal fans want (in this order): Villa, Diame, Fellaini, Wanyama, Capoue, Cavani (realistic?) 
 Monsieur Alain Pardeux in 2006:   I had to wonder where that British involvement was when I saw the Arsenal team.   1/2 
Fair play to Arsenal fans giving me stick over Villa - fully deserved #gottotakeitifyoudishitout
Fancy a Chelsea win but Swansea through and a big Arsenal win tonight.
 @richgooner1886 In the spirit of goodwill, good luck tonight - I hope you enjoy the game. For what it's worth I think Arsenal 3-0 win 
 Brighton fail to take great chance, Arsenal go up the other end and Giroud scores with a lovely finish. 1-0 Arsenal 
Game on. Arsenal defending today is poor so far. 1-1 Barnes header

@savagemattsav because Levy does Tottenham's transfers and Wenger does Arsenal's
I'm at L'Emirates for Arsenal-Liverpool tonight and really looking forward to it. Big game for both clubs and should be quite open.
Really enjoyed the Arsenal-Liverpool game last night - thought Suarez superb in first half and Wilshere superb throughout.
 Arsenal need a back-up left-back? Kevin Conboy, Danish international plays for NEC and available for 2million Euros. Players are out there 
Monreal business very clever from Arsenal but I still think they really need a no 6 midfielder.
But I think Tottenham's need is greater than Arsenal's in final hours of window...
 @johncrossmirror agree good signing, but staggered by spurs inactivity. There was a real chance for them to get 1 up on Arsenal 
@johncrossmirror barring a last minute drama I'm now pretty confident arsenal will finish above spurs.
 On the back of deadline day I think Manchester United win the title, Arsenal finish fourth and Villa, Reading, QPR to go down.

@rwilliams1947 @ian_ladyman_dm I'm convinced jamie carragher coloured his boots in black for last weeks arsenal game.
 My Arsenal moan is that while Monreal looks a v good signing, they are now paying upwards of £150k a week for 3 left backs. Perfect model? 
 Anyway, enough Arsenal. Daniel Levy proved himself a transfer genius again and as for the Chelsea 'strategy'. Wow, where to start with that? 
 I see the Arsenal website has a new look. Pretty, pretty good. 
 Lambert saying Benteke would only be sold for big money, not that he won't be sold. Uh oh, roll up Spurs, Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City 
Giroud Arsenal's player of the month - richly deserved IMO. Winning the doubters over and proving to be a good signing.
Andre Santos always struck me as finding it quite funny he had somehow managed to end up at Arsenal.
Bentley getting a standing ovation from Arsenal fans as he warms up. Not.
This is like a training game. Arsenal attack. Blackburn defend.
 Kean, Martin Olsson and Grant Hanley pick of Blackburn heroes. Rosicky the pick of Arsenal's, err, players. 
 It has been a trend for too long that goalkeepers get worse at Arsenal, not better. 
@timpayton I know. Don't think anything short term would ultimately help tho. I still think Arsenal will finish 4th above Spurs.

Wenger tells Arsenal team they need to be men ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-just-not-good-enough-1713864 …
 My opinion is Wenger should leave Arsenal at the end of the season. But those saying 'he doesn't have a clue' etc, just remember.... 
 @lionel_morgan it's the big question. Klopp looks perfectly suited to Arsenal but not sure he'd take it. Moyes, De Boer, Ancelotti 
 @lionel_morgan I take your point but Arsenal had a lot of money to spend in summer and January, but Wenger stuck to philosophy. 
 @lionel_morgan also Ancelotti did superb job at Chelsea. It's a myth to say Wenger the only capable boss for Arsenal, however good he was/is 
@lionel_morgan nobody has a 'right' to win a trophy but plenty of worse teams than Arsenal have over past eight years.

@DarrenArsenal1 @philmcnulty @piersmorgan but I agree Wenger should go a the end of the season - even if Arsenal nick fourth place.
@JWTelegraph @ollieholt22 but arsenal model means Wenger can't afford to make as many mistakes as others in transfer market...
@Arsenal_SAfrica no it wasn't!
 As promised, my web column comes early. Arsenal need to feel the pressure #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-column-truth-wenger-not-1716442 … 
 @MattGunner32 @timpayton don't worry, Arsenal will be fine on Sat! 
@boydhilton @northgooner agree with that Boyd. Big key is Arsenal not conceding.
@Anthony_M_Eaton why? Arsenal is a great club with or without Wenger.
 @JanAageFjortoft what about his £7.5m contract and position of total power at Arsenal? Is that not the reward? Saying that, I will miss him. 
 @basil_90 schalke finished with 12 points, Arsenal 10. Schalke drew final game, Arsenal lost. Had Arsenal won they would have won group. 
@basil_90 but arsenal would have had 13 points (1 more than Schalke) had they won. Schalke win would have made it impossible for Arsenal.
I'm at Arsenal tonight and really want them to win. My only prediction is the tie will still be alive for 2nd leg.
Arsenal were beaten by a much better side. Inquest shouldn't be about the result but how they have fallen so far behind Europe's top clubs.
Last couple of thoughts after game. Cazorla on wing didn't work and subbing Podolski looked like a mistake. But Arsenal will beat Villa.
@JonnyOneill ....maybe then Arsenal can keep him forever!
 Worth remembering that Arsenal could have been facing Galatasaray in Champs League last 16, but Wenger tossed away that chance...1/2 
 The Arsenal bench in Olympiakos for Arsenal's final group game was Shea, Angha, Hajrovic, Monteiro, Arshavin, Akpom, Ansah... 
The Olympiakos matchday squad has got to be one of the worst decisions of Wenger's entire Arsenal reign.
 @10akhil haha, you fans with your standing up so we cant see what's happening!! Thought Arsenal fans were v good last night. Stuck with team 
@10akhil I thought Arsenal did ok against a v good side. It is other decisions both from wenger and the board that has really cost them.
@QueenofSuburbia not quite that specifically in terms of cash but yes that has been asked a lot. He always says Arsenal should not be...
 @DominicaAFC Schalke finished top with 12 points, Arsenal second with 10. A win in Olympiakos and Arsenal finish with 13 points.... 
@philip_AFC schalke finished top with 12 points. Arsenal second with 10. Arsenal win and they finish with 13 points
 I'm quick enough to moan when players don't front up, so I should say there was no hiding from Arsenal players and press team last night, 
@jeffnorthlondon what about making the best decisions? Not all of Arsenal + Wenger's problems are cash related.
 Thought Arsenal were quite poor today but result far more important than performance. Villa encouraging, Weimann very good, but naive again.

Wenger won't stand for any negative Arsenal attitudes in Munich #afc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/bayern-munich-vs-arsenal-preview-1753731 …
 I'm off to Munchen tomorrow, where Arsenal are clearly going to overturn the 3-1 deficit to knock Bayern out of the CL on Wednesday night. 
 Arsenal team v Olympiakos: Szczesny, jenkinson, squillaci, vermaelen, Meade, rosicky, coquelin, gervinho, Ramsey, Ox, chamakh.... 
 .....Subs: Shea, angha, hajrovic, monteiro, arshavin, akpom, ansah. Losing that game meant Arsenal could not finish top of the group. 
 Other than financial benefit, you could question whether its worth Arsenal qualifying for the CL if they haven't got squad to cope with it 
 I'll admit it, Arsenal surprised me tonight. Wasn't sure they had that in them even tho they still went out. Plenty of encouragement

Watching Chelsea-Arsenal in the NextGen series - immediately struck by the terrible pitch they're having to play on.
 Lovely goal - Arsenal 1-up. Brilliant pass by gnabry, found on rushing bellerin and he crosses for akpom to score. 
Arsenal's best prospect is not playing in this game. There is a lad they are incredibly excited about but I'm sworn to secrecy. Sorry.
Constantly surprised by level of knowledge of most fans on here. A lot of Arsenal supporters clearly know what's going on under the 1st team
Feruz follows up penalty save to make it Chelsea 1 - Arsenal 1 in NextGen.
 Oh dear, horrible keeper error. Baker scores. Chelsea now 2-1 up against Arsenal in NextGen but they probably deserve it. 
It's all Arsenal now. Could have won it in injury time. Great turnaround.
Chelsea to meet eventual winners Aston Villa in the final of the NextGen. Missed extra-time but the first 90 mins v Arsenal were very good.
Goalscoring machine Gervinho puts Arsenal 1-up against Reading
Not sure how that wasn't a pen for Arsenal after Giroud was cleaned out by Taylor
Another pen shout for Arsenal and then Cazorla has a shot blocked. Arsenal could be 4 up. Far too easy at the moment.
 This is the most one-sided first-half you are ever likely to see, but Arsenal still only 1-up.

@cfcasa @johncrossmirror I'm at Fulham-Arsenal.
At Fulham - fancy a big Arsenal win
 Mertesacker puts Arsenal one-up, which is harsh on Fulham who have been good since going down to 10 men. Arsenal should stroll this now. 
Seemed a harsh red for Giroud. I would expect Arsenal to appeal.

Those Arsenal zippys look like Manchester United zippys
@QueenofSuburbia Arsenal have big plans. The trick is making them happen.
I agree 3rd and 4th place should go to head-to-head results and not a play-off if Chelsea and Arsenal are tied. Doubt Arsenal fans agree.
Seems a lot of Arsenal fans do agree with me it should go down to head-to-head (which Chelsea won). How sporting.
Wenger will have his biggest transfer budget - whether or not Arsenal qualify for the Champions League #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfers-arsene-wenger-spend-1897461 …
 Can't see anything but Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham wins - which will put them in that order #cfc #afc #thfc 
Always thought Arsenal would finish 4th and I still think it's not some sort of amazing achievement 4 them. But fair play for catching Spurs
@northbanklower @youaremyarsenal if Arsenal want to win the title Arteta shouldn't be in the starting team next season.

 @angelasmith_ @apb1979 disagree job too soon for Bould. The Arsenal players think he's superb. But, yes, he is happy there. 
 After bold words of Gazidis, Arsenal will have to review their policy of making opening bids of a button and the promise of some magic beans 
My Arsenal striker info hasn't held for tomorrow's paper so may as well share. They are far more confident on Higuain than any other target

Man Utd stars want end to Rooney sideshow as Chelsea and Arsenal watch. Bit of Suarez news too #mufc #cfc #afc #lfc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/wayne-rooney-transfer-arsenal-chelsea-2032767 …
Some Suarez and Arsenal tweets.....
1. I wrote on Sunday of Arsenal's enquiry over Suarez in a Rooney article. Info was not given to me by an Arsenal source or leaked by club
2. Excellent Merseyside reporters have today taken the story on by confirming Arsenal actually had a bid rejected for Suarez.
3. People assuming that means Arsenal's bid was a bluff to try to get Higuain and that may be the case.
 3. But given story not leaked by Arsenal to my knowledge and story has come from Merseyside, there is another possibility..... 
4. Liverpool want news of Arsenal failed bid out there to get Real Madrid to start bidding for Suarez over £30million.....?
 Just thoughts, but I have been given no indication that Arsenal's Suarez enquiry and subsequent bid was a bluff over Higuain. 
Manchester United and Arsenal have one month to sign Fellaini before price rockets #mufc #afc #efc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-arsenals-marouane-fellaini-2050689 …
Can someone tell me the point of Arsenal bidding £35million for Luis Suarez?
@neilashton_ haha. I'd love to know if there is a person at Arsenal who actually thinks they could sign Suarez for 35m
And I just don't see this whole 'Arsenal are using Suarez as a way to get Higuain theory'....
 A 30-35m bid for Suarez from Arsenal might force a smile from Real, but it won't force their hand. 
I've asked repeated questions of whether Cesc could rejoin Arsenal this summer and always been told 'he'll give it another year at Barca'...
My understanding of Arsenal buy-back clause on Cesc is that it only becomes applicable if Cesc informs Barca he wants to return to Arsenal
If Cesc tells Barca he wants Arsenal then there is a set fee of about £25m. If Cesc doesn't ask for Arsenal move then any club can buy him
@Yahzzz not true. It's dependent on Cesc saying he wants Arsenal
 @johncrossmirror but arsenal first option only applies if Cesc says he wants Arsenal. Otherwise, no option. 
 @jeffnorthlondon what would you rate the percentage chance of Suarez playing for Arsenal next season, Jeff? 
@Priceym1886 I was laughing at the pointless £30-35m bid. I don't doubt Arsenal really want him but I'm not as confident as Jeff. 30%
Arsenal add Luiz Gustavo to their list of targets #afc ://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-luiz-gustavo-2071188 …
Not sure I understand Arsenal's thinking over the £1. Suarez camp would surely know of offer anyway and it unnecessarily angers Liverpool.
 By end of Arsenal/Suarez/Liverpool saga, Madrid may well know price, know if the clause counts, know Suarez terms and look like good guys 
 Of course, Madrid also risk that Suarez will already be wearing an Arsenal shirt by the time they know all that. 
So what happens if Arsenal don't get Suarez?
 I'm glad it didn't happen, but i think Arsenal should have signed Benteke two weeks ago. Suarez will want to leave In 2 years anyway 
 On plus side, glad to see this story from last month on Arsenal's interest in Luiz Gustavo is moving on #afc://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/arsenal-transfer-news-luiz-gustavo-2071188 …

Arsenal v Villa for me today. Easy to forget in the transfer chaos that this Arsenal team finished last season with 8 wins from 10
@johnnie_jackson 3-0 arsenal. Theo to get 2. You?
Arsenal have Frimpong on the bench today. A Championship player at best.
Vlaar mistake led to Arsenal opening goal. But v good finish from Giroud. 1-0 Arsenal
No Arsenal defender followed up Benteke's saved pen and the striker heads into the net. Arsenal 1 Aston Villa 1
H/T Arsenal 1 Aston Villa 1
 Boos at half-time, but I think they were from Arsenal fans for the ref rather than aimed at the team or Wenger. 
Delph hits the inside of the Arsenal post
But Arsenal should be able to deal with Villa tactics. No problem with them being physical.
 Didn't think that was a pen, but Benteke takes it brilliantly. Arsenal 1, Aston Villa 2 
 Arsenal rightly upset with ref, but Cazorla did terribly to be robbed by Agbonlahor before he went down under Koscielny challenge 
No gloating from me tonight. Villa front 3 were superb and the ref had a shocker. Arsenal's squad so thin and it was highlighted today.

Why is it Arsenal's responsibility to decide when it would be best for Newcastle to bid for one of their players?

Lloris was man of the match by some distance and that says it all. It's been gutsy from Arsenal since the Villa defeat.
 If I was Arsenal (and I'm not), I would go in late for Steven Fletcher as a number two striker. Much better than Ba and back to fitness. 
 And I've been saying all summer Arsenal should have signed Benteke. Fortunately, I think (and hope) it's too late now. 
 What a weird window for Arsenal. One mega deal, two frees and a loan. And what a disaster (so far) for Manchester United.

Sunderland v Arsenal for me today. Wetherby services provided a boost after a tres early start. Looking forward to this one.
 11 mins, Ozil great control on left, passes to Giroud who scores with left-foot shot. 1-0 Arsenal and a bit of the £42.4m paid off 
 Fair to say Ozil looks pretty, pretty good. Just put Walcott through again, but his shot saved. Arsenal could be 3 up. 
Gardner sent on as sub. Koscielny fouls Johnson in the area and Gardner scores pen. Sunderland 1 Arsenal 1

 To be clear I'm not saying Arsenal will win the League, but they definitely can. 
@talkSPORTDrive one problem to your Hart-Arsenal idea may be that Hart and Szczesny share the same agent.
@talkSPORTDrive that agent played a big part in persuading Szczesny to stick it out at Arsenal when he was dropped last season.

I'm yet to hear a really good reason why Arsenal shouldn't win the PL this season and yet most people (me included) don't think they will.

 I should add that a player being rated at £15m by a club does not mean he will end up costing that much. Cardiff's valuation, not Arsenal's 
 Marshall only signed new contract in Feb. I'm not aware of a clause, so unless there is one Cardiff will want big money. Arsenal will haggle

@OllieHolt22 @johncrossmirror The Arsenal glory years is only available on VHS i'm led to believe.
 My top four prediction (in order) is: Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United. Bottom three: C Palace, West Brom, Burnley. 
 Alex Song on a free loan would be a very good signing for Tottenham, Everton or Manchester United. Had a v good final season at Arsenal.

Arsenal's consistency in the CL is superb + Wenger deserves much credit for it. But I don't think the competition should reward consistency

My first Villa game was a 5-0 defeat at home to Arsenal in the year Villa were relegated and i cheered all five Arsenal goals....

Very rare to see an Arsenal player take a penalty that he won. Sanchez did and saw a terrible effort saved. Still 0-0 at the Emirates
 He may have fluffed his pen, but QPR defenders cannot cope with Sanchez. Arsenal tactic must be just to get the ball to him. 
 Gibbs cross, Sanchez header. 1-0 Arsenal. Redknapp will be fuming that Sanchez was left unmarked inside six-yard box 
2-0 Arsenal. Brilliant run from Sanchez and well taken goal by Rosicky.
Austin pen 2-1 Arsenal. Wenger unhappy with decision after Hoilett went down under Debuchy challenge.

In less than 1 day Arsenal's prognosis on Arteta goes from 3 months to 6 weeks - no wonder people think their medical dep is a shambles
Cesc Fabregas has 20 assists in all comps for Chelsea. Thierry Henry assisted 23 goals in all comps for Arsenal in 2002/03. 20 in PL
As pointed out by about a million Arsenal fans Henry also got 32 goals 02/03. 32 goals and 23 assists in just outrageously good.

Impressive result for Arsenal today. Surely this is the season they last the pace and challenge to the final weeks
 @10akhil in all seriousness, Jeremy does a superb job on Arsenal so once I joined the Tele I agreed to do more Chelsea 
 @10akhil Haha, I actually tipped Arsenal for the title in our updated predictions last week - admittedly my tip in the summer was Chelsea! 
I'm not sure what's wrong with me but I've become convinced Arsenal are going to win the league. Must be a lack of sleep.

Alan Shearer can't have been watching when Walcott rescued Arsenal against Leicester. Arsenal have far bigger problems than Walcott.
If Arsenal had serious ambition they would have moved for Guardiola. But their only real ambition is top four so Wenger is perfect.
My views on Wenger haven't suddenly changed. I've thought he was part of the problem and not the answer for Arsenal for at least three years
@johncrossmirror we've disagreed on Arsenal's 'ambition' and Wenger for some time mate. I don't think we'll find common ground on that one!

So people think Arsenal would let Ozil + Sanchez go for free in 18 months (losing £80m) and have to spend £100m to replace them both. Ok.
it's the best Arsenal squad for quite some time.

 @rossarsenal I would take a lot of heart from what Wenger said today - as Arsenal fans know, he can be very stubborn #arsenal 
 At Cameroon training at a local durban school - few thous watching, carnival atmos- alex song looks sprightly after injury #arsenal 
 @rossarsenal I reckon they will persuade him to do one more season but, in truth, nobody knows what will happen, even Fab, Arsenal or Barca 
 @WorldCupTele Arsenal have asked Fulham about Schwarzer and I think it will happen but, on this evidence, Ozil = ideal Fabregas replacement 
There's a definite message to Barca in unveiling of new Arsenal away kit. Fabregas features prominently in advert #arsenal
 @rossarsenal have only seen him v Australia and #eng Under-21s. On that evidence yes, but Serbia match will tell us more #arsenal #ger 
 At Spain press con; feeling is that Fabregas and Torres will be on bench. In theory, they are the best team by a mile. #esp #arsenal #lfc 
 Tough start next season for #arsenal with MU, Liv, Man C, Villa, Evert, Chels all away before xmas. All PL fixtures at ://bit.ly/10s9D7 
Arsenal getting close to signing Laurent Koscielny ://tinyurl.com/35uw3oj #arsenal
 @rossarsenal Doubt it; would be no suprise to see Eduardo go but still leaves RVP, Chamakh, Bendtner competing for central role #arsenal 
Blog on Sol Campbell and why he should stop moaning about England & repay Wenger's faith ://tinyurl.com/22uo9hw #arsenal #eng #worldcup
 @rossarsenal Don't think it changes anything - all hot air - if Barca offer money Arsenal think fair, a deal will be done - simple #arsenal 
@Cmacgunner77 Here's the latest on Arsenal transfer activity...://tinyurl.com/325hcod
 Full link in tweet below: But Koscielny all but done, #arsenal still working on Schwarzer plus latest on Cole, Eduardo, Gallas, Sol, Fab 
@ssmudhar I think he will try and get one more year from him. But if money is huge (£45m+) I think #arsenal may be tempted now
@rosscoarsenal You could say it's stating obvious as Fab can't force #arsenal to sell but it does suggest he might be resigned to that fact
 @rosscoarsenal it's very possible: iniesta, xavi, busquets all in Spain/Barca teams..plus add Kieta and Messi at Barca! #arsenal 
Good news from #arsenal training ground on Ramsey and Gibbs. Ramsey back running and training in gym. Gibbs should be ok for full pre-season
@randomanomaly Arsenal cautious on saying a date; the good news is there's no ankle damage unlike Eduardo so would hope well b4 xmas
 Fabregas story: ://tinyurl.com/33v6tb9
Still a long way until transfer window closes, but any agreement looks a way off for now #arsenal 
 Koscielny #arsenal deal confirmed earlier today, seems like a pretty confident chap: ://tinyurl.com/34vtmhz 
 Fabregas:   This victory is for all the Arsenal players and fans - they are a world-class club. I am an Arsenal player and proud to be.   
Arsenal not offended by Fabregas shirt joke: ://tinyurl.com/39egnq7
 @Cmacgunner77 It's true, but was then anyone in the Spain midfield built for such a scrap? AW thinks Arsenal can win in a similar way 
 Off to Wenger press conference later. Much on the agenda: Fabregas, defenders, goalkeepers - and a new season #arsenal 
 At #arsenal v AC Milan, Ars: 4-2-3-1: Fabianski; Eboue, Vermaelen, Koscielny, Gibbs; Frimpong, Wilshere; Rosicky, Nasri, Arshavin; Chamakh 
Quality Arsenal goal; both the pass from Arshavin and finish by Chamakh....#arsenal 1 Milan 0
Match report: Arsenal 1 AC Milan 1: ://tinyurl.com/2fezckp
 Arsenal line up v Celtic (4-2-3-1) Almunia; Sagna, Vermaelen, Djourou, Clichy; Frimpong, Wilshere; Walcott, Vela, Rosicky; Emmanuel-Thomas 
Main issues of interest at #arsenal today: Almunia and goalkeepers; Theo starting and Djourou lining up with Vermaelen
Cheers for cesc at the emirates - these arsenal fans are just so nice
One interesting thing at Arsenal training today was Frimpong and Wilshere playing quite a bit together in central midfield again...
Arsenal now sure Fabregas will stay: ://tinyurl.com/2ul6y95
Good news for Arsenal with Fab statement (as reported in today's Telegraph!)refreshing that he did not try to deny his interest in Barca
 Song, Diaby, Denilson and Fabregas all v doubtful. Ramsey not back until November. #Arsenal midfield could be interesting vs Liverpool #lfc 
 @EboueClan November is the aim for Ramsey, has been running gently but still a good three months to go before he can play #arsenal

 #arsenal fan survey results: Main points= not keen on takeover and want AW to focus on trophies, including FA Cup ://tinyurl.com/2443mmy 
Just spoke to #fulham and they are adamant that Mark Schwarzer has not put in transfer request...still think he may well end up at #arsenal
 Wenger contract extension no great surprise (talks started months ago), but important - would have become a big distraction #arsenal 
Stat of day: #arsenal striker chamakh has scored more headed goals than anyone in europe over last 2yrs
 @imaginejonny Yes, Chamakh will need supply, but should give #arsenal a variation beyond trying to pass through the middle of teams 
 Wenger on recent failure to win a trophy: “For me a trophy is the championship or the Champions League.   Think #arsenal fans may disagree 
Arsenal still want Schwarzer rather than Given and are ready to make a fresh bid: ://tinyurl.com/2wsq5k9 #arsenal
Blog on #arsenal and why it is a mistake for club to dismiss importance of FA Cup and League Cup ://tinyurl.com/335ub5y
 @EmiratesGunner Hard to say, certainly think Arsenal would want it done before Blackburn away 
Good news for #arsenal is that Johan Djourou is back training so should be in contention for Saturday when Koscielny will be suspended
Looks like #arsenal will have two fit senior centre-backs for Saturday after all: ://tinyurl.com/2f8dn9k
Excellent new scheme at Arsenal to encourage every fan to become a shareholder in club: ://tinyurl.com/24uh3s6

No shortage of riot police on hand outside partizan belgrade stadium ahead of #arsenal game
Brief power cut affected parts of Partizan ground..every arsenal player getting unique local welcome - it's all rather different to Emirates
 Arsenal (4-2-3-1): Fabianski; Sagna, Squillaci, Djourou, Gibbs; Denilson, Song; Roiscky, Wilshere, Arshavin; Chamakh 
 Six #arsenal changes from Saturday. Fabianski starts, Djourou in for Koscielny and looks like a more attacking position for Jack Wilshere 
 Lights on and huge banner to greet Arsenal saying:   You have been run over by a steamroller  . It's some atmopshere for return of Fabianski 
 @pauljmason It's fine now, plenty of light in Belgrade...especially from Wilshere #arsenal 
Fabianski and wilshere the stars for #arsenal - players reduced to using their phones to see in dressing room after power cut

 Wenger says he was surprised at how   easy   Chelsea were to dominate: ://tinyurl.com/3am6a4q #cfc #arsenal 
@Arselona I think MU and CFC have found way to play #Arsenal: possession irrelevant if you dont score and cant cope with counter-attacks
 Robert Pires back training at #arsenal and in   sparkling   form according to Wenger. But virtually no chance of him returning permanently 
 Alex to have a scan on his thigh today, results expected tomorrow. Diaby likely to pull out of France squad with ankle injury. #cfc #arsenal 
@ssmudhar I think highly unlikely. AW much more cautious over 'elderly' forwards. Plus #arsenal do have plenty of attacking midfielders
Schwarzer still talking today like he is keen to join #arsenal - I'm expecting a deal to finally get done in January
 @attwood99 No, just my view...he is 37 this month and Arsenal hardly short of players in his position 
Blog on why #arsenal keep on failing against Chelsea and Man U: ://tinyurl.com/2v6dn6x
Alex pulls out of Brazil squad and is out for three weeks with thigh injury. Chelsea say it happened after his free-kick v Arsenal #cfc

 Cesc Fabregas on Arsenal:   A winning mentality is missing. We just need to start winning titles because we have a wealth of quality.   
Off to wenger press conference. Will he side with Big Sam or Danny Murphy over tackling? #arsenal
Koscielny out for #arsenal with back injury - leaves only squillaci and djourou at centre-back unless song plays out of position
Eboue admitted yesterday that Wenger has said nothing to him about his 'scissor' tackle on Ridgewell...double standards from AW? #arsenal

 Mixed injury news for #Arsenal. Vermaelen looking like another three weeks. Almunia still out, but Sagna back 
 @randomanomaly @The2020 yes, Fabianski really has his chance now..feels like make or break for his #arsenal career

 Eduardo starts for Shakhtar v Arsenal: Pyatov; Srna, Rakitskiy, Chygrynskiy, Rat; Gai, Hubschman; Jadson, Eduardo, Willian; Adriano 
On arsenal tv fans' forum from 815pm with tom watt - hope to hear from some of you...#arsenal
Arshavin out as Walcott starts. Van Persie on bench...Squillaci and Koscielny in central defence #arsenal
 Very worrying news for Arsenal on Vermaelen. If this goes on much longer, surgery will surely be an option...#arsenal 
 Wenger may go long ball?   We might find a way to play a bit more direct in some situations because everybody drops deep against us.  #arsenal 
 #Arsenal v Wolves (4-2-3-1) Fabianski; Sagna, Djourou, Squillaci, Clichy; Song, Wilshere; Rosicky, Fabregas, Arshavin; Chamakh 
 #Wolves v Arsenal (4-1-4-1) Hahnemann; Foley, Stearman, Berra, Ward; Henry; Edwards, Mancienne, Milijas, Jarvis; Doyle 
apologies from Fabregas and Wenger after captain's 'scissor' tackle on Stephen Ward #arsenal
@samuelruback Yes and there was one from Milijas..but think there's been a change in #arsenal this season..rather more willing to 'mix it'
 @Hustlinpup I really dont think they do...but all high profile teams, including Arsenal, get more attention for everything they do

 #arsenal line-up tonight shows Wenger now thinks he knows his best team. Third time in a row for these players, discounting Wigan match 
 arsenal still on top, but Man City have learnt from first half and much more solid. De Jong excellent in front of defence #mcfc 
Wilshere been the best player at the Emirates so far. Should surely start next England game #arsenal #mcfc
@andrewleese89 He also drops so deep there is often no-one in box but links the play so well. Think #arsenal better with RVP than without

Jack Wilshere now likely to miss #arsenal summer tour and possibly start of next season...://tinyurl.com/3ppyt7w
 @mumith_k Yes and no, depending on how you look at it..you get more games with #arsenal season ticket but it costs more. 
 @jonnyth14 Yes, important to understand that #arsenal structured differently to #thfc and some fans wouldn't want to pay for extra cup games 
 @jonnyth14 Yes, you could debate all night what is best value but sure most arsenal fans would like more flexibility and choice 
@timpayton Not the best week for salaries of directors and money for selling shares to come out...#arsenal

 Thunder, lightening and lots of rain in Yiwu for last match of arsenal's pre-season asia tour. Kick off 1230pm uk time

 Fascinating new Q&A interview here with Wenger, the philosopher: ://tinyurl.com/3fxmnfb  #arsenal 
 Wenger on Nasri and Fab:   They both love the club and are very happy with us. Hopefully we can keep them both happy here.   #arsenal 
 Fabreags, Almunia, Bendtner and Eboue will all miss trip to Cologne for #arsenal 
@timpayton Yes...might not look so good for Arsenal then..should think Blackpool might even be top on last season
 Few bits of #arsenal info: walcott unlikely to play in em cup, but should be okay for start of season... 
 ...and wenger keen to make a signing in next few days, mata looks favourite but he also wants a centre-back #arsenal 
 @mj_afc Thinking that Nasri moves more centre if Fab goes. If Fab stays, Arsenal have to be tempted by £20m+ for Nasri 
 @Marcus_JH23 I wouldnt rule out a centre-back if Mata doesnt get done, but sure Arsenal are pushing hard for one more signing b4 em cup 
@LucaHelvetica @nickstone22 Any deal can fall through but l do know that Arsenal are pushing very hard to get one done before weekend
 Arsenal fans, we have the opportunity to put some of your questions to Aaron Ramsey ahead of the Emirates Cup. Plse fire away...#emiratescup 
Interesting #arsenal developments...back in for Jagielka. Wenger wants it done quickly but can't see Moyes making it easy #efc
Wenger also wants Fabregas situation sorted one or another by Sunday (end of July) and Barcelona are aware of this..#arsenal
#Arsenal keen on Mata but that is more Fabregas dependent so dont expect more progress b4 nxt week. Jagielka is who they are working on now
Story on Jagielka and Fabregas...so will Everton hold out for £18m? ://tinyurl.com/443n5dh  #arsenal #efc
 With bendtner, eboue and clichy sales, arsenal should be able to afford gervinho, jagielka and mata without selling fabregas 
Aaron Ramsey interview and fans' Q&A ://tinyurl.com/3uqjtag  #arsenal
@timpayton Fabregas should be more upset with Barca than Arsenal..it's in their court..but worst of all worlds at the moment
 Strong Arsenal team today: Szczesny; Sagna, Vermaelen, Koscielny, Gibbs; Song, Wilshere; Rosicky, Ramsey, Gervinho; Van Persie 
Late own goals costs Arsenal the Emirates Cup...booing on the final whistle..
@gold_gooner31 The surprise was supposed to be that Henry would play last five mins for #arsenal but ref wouldnt allow it..
@Howley_1 Not sure that a fee has been agreed yet but do think he prefers idea of Arsenal to Spurs. so looks promising for #arsenal
 Wenger also made a point of praising Vermaelen/Koscielny combo...pretty sure #arsenal will start with that, new signings/injuries permitting 
@EirikHOP Good question..Arsenal had wanted it done quickly but Wenger now referring to Aug 31 as the only deadline
@joshooahw Clause existed to get him cheaper. Arsenal want him + Valencia can still accept less thn €60m but danger now is of bidding war.

Wenger saying that Fabregas not in Benfica because he is not fit to play. #arsenal
 Wenger: “I love Fabregas and I want him to stay, that is basically it.   #arsenal 
 Wenger:   He is just coming back from injury and is not ready to play in a game. But he is not injured.” #arsenal 
 Everyone blaming Kompany for winner, but Clichy also partly to blame. One player Wenger was not so desperate to keep #mcfc #arsenal 
 Some Arsenal news; Wenger closing in on Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joel Campbell, will also try for centre-back this week 
Total fee for Oxlade-Chamberlain - who is at Arsenal's training HQ today - is £12m.big price for player with only Lge1 experience
 Saints eventually received £7m for Gareth Bale, £8m for Walcott..Oxlade-Chamberlain could be £12m within a yr #saintsfc #arsenal 
Interesting detail on Oxlade-Chamberlain is that Man U asked to be kept informed but were not willing to pay £12m. #mufc #saintsfc #arsenal
Oxlade Chamberlain signs but Manchester City now preparing a bid for Samir Nasri ://tinyurl.com/3s64vsh  #arsenal #mcfc
@TMB04 @Gooner_66 Agreed. Noises coming out of #arsenal on Nasri are different from a few weeks ago. Interesting few days ahead
Nasri and Fabregas both in Champions League squad list for Udinese. They would be cup-tied if they play for #arsenal
Laurent blanc suggests he wants nasri to leave #arsenal asap. no great surprise - he shares same agent
Wenger now reluctantly prepared to sell both Fabregas and Nasri for £60m. Story here...://tinyurl.com/3fhdqdm  #arsenal
Arsenal agree Fabregas deal: ://tinyurl.com/3w7sdtt 
@PatrickACrowley Yes agree. A victory for player power and Barca tactics...Arsenal left with little choice
 So what is feeling of Arsenal fans towards Fabregas? He tried hard, even when he wanted to leave, but shouldn't have kept captaincy last yr 
There is a feeling at #arsenal that they would've got £50m on open market (Chels and Man C interested)..but Fabregas only wanted Barca
Barton's tweets under FA scrutiny and Song very likely to get 3-game ban...://tinyurl.com/3b8psek  #nufc #arsenal
 The one positive is that Fabregas did only cost £600,000 from Barca...net profit for Arsenal of £34.4m 
Biggest issue for Arsenal is whether Wenger vision survives. It depends on best young players staying for their prime yrs...

Interesting Nasri quotes on Arsenal. Funny how some players talk as if they are bystanders in a club's fortunes.
They should have moved quicker but £10m for Mertesacker shows why Arsenal reluctant to pay £15m+ for Cahill/Jagielka
Santos confirmed at #arsenal but otherwise surprisingly quiet...hearing that they are working towards one more deal
 yes, Arsenal working specifically on one more on top of mertesacker/santos...almost certainly a midfielder but its not benayoun 
 Following on from my earlier tweet, the player Arsenal still hoping to sign is understood to be Arteta #arsenal #efc 
Hearing that a Benayoun loan is still possible for Arsenal...not completely clear if this is instead or as well as Arteta
Looking now like #Arsenal could end up with Arteta and Benayoun..
@DarrenArsenal1 I'm not defending Arsenal's transfer window. Just saying they will need some of it have a chance of keeping key players
Confirmed. Arsenal have signed Arteta on four year deal and Benayoun on one year loan
A good day for Arsenal. They are much stronger in defence and slightly better up front than last yr. Just midfield that is in question

 @hem_arsenal Agree. I don't say Spurs are favourites. They will need a bit of luck but, if they keep key players fit, anything's possible 
@hem_arsenal Thanks for the feedback - the injury point was in there
Last point on Spurs. They've got 45 points in 18 games since Ade/Parker arrived - better ratio than Arsenal Invincible season #thfc #afc
 @hem_arsenal Agree, they've had a bit of luck and will need a bit more but most teams do. Lack of injuries could be linked to no Europe? 
 Not trying to annoy Arsenal fans, just justifying view that Spurs have a genuine chance..they have been motoring since end of August

Also don't rule out third option on RVP: He doesn't sign a contract but Arsenal make him see out contract until 2013
@everymatchboy @Gingers4Limpar But he doesn't necessarily get that choice. Arsenal could hold him to contract and Real would have to bid
@arsenalaction But say Arsenal finish 5th and need to get back into champ league (worth abt £40m) - could then be false economy to sell RVP
Arsenal fans singing 2-0 and you ****** it up - would have thought they have seen enough of their team not to tempt fate yet
@RorySmithTimes and Arsenal the old Arsenal and Tottenham the old spurs? We'll see

 New era at Arsenal tomorrow, not just due to RVP but because Cazorla, Podolski and Giroud = long-term replacements for Fabregas, Nasri, RVP 
Nuri Sahin deal now very close...should certainly be done in time for Arsenal's trip to Stoke next Sunday
 Arsenal £2m in credit so far this summer. 
£39m in for Song/RVP: £37m out for Cazorla/Podolski/Giroud/Sahin..thoughts?

 Looking like sahin to liverpool..but, if so, because arsenal walked away. Didn't like size of option/loan fee. #lfc #afc 
 Arsenal offer to Walcott is £75,000-a-week. No sense that they will improve it. Ending feels inevitable 
Liverpool only club to have made an inquiry to Arsenal for Walcott...but Man City also interested
Mood at Arsenal is that they hope Walcott changes his mind but they are open to offers if not...
Arsenal also believe they have options in Theo's position...aside from Ox/Gervinho there is big hope for Serge Gnabry

 For what it's worth on Walcott, Arsenal have cover but also think it is easy to focus on his weaknesses and forget he has rare strengths 
Arsenal expecting one addition today. They have inquired for Michael Essien and  Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa.
Defensive midfielder is priority for Arsenal but they are also monitoring what's happening with Clint Dempsey
Arsenal not expecting any permanent deals. Could be some loans out. Club will have made profit of around £10m this summer...
Arsenal: Park and Bendtner should get loan moves away today. Chamakh looks like staying. Inquiry for Essien but unlikely to happen

 Although Arsenal have problems keeping established players, there's a good argument that they still offer most to young players like Zaha... 
Gervinho getting lots of stick at Arsenal. Final ball v erratic but getting into more dangerous positions than anyone else on the pitch
Think Gervinho did OK today and his running (if not finishing) was v important for Arsenal. Less contentious is that Wilshere was excellent

 Lots of people questioning Arsenal's wage policy so I checked how often, under Wenger, they finished below a team who pay less. Any guesses? 
 Of course that could change next year. Arsenal 4th biggest payers at moment in wages, if not transfer fees, behind Man U, Man C and Chelsea

 Big boost for Arsenal, as reported in Telegraph this morning, 5 young Brit internationals sign deals until 2017/2018. Pressure now on Theo

 With Santos playing record and Gibbs' injury record, hasn't Arsenal left back position been accident waiting to happen? 
 Thierry Henry persuaded Mr Usmanov to buy shares in Arsenal. In fact,
 in the interview, which was translated from Russian, Mr Usmanov said 
Interesting. Correction issued to say Usmanov's quotes may have been misinterpreted and he did NOT say Henry wants him to buy Arsenal
Looking increasingly likely that Arsenal will make one signing. Nacho Monreal. Wonder if we'll see Andre Santos in an Arsenal shirt again
Etienne Capoue still on Arsenal's radar this summer - as is a striker - but Wenger committed to core of squad ://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/9853955/Arsenal-manager-Arsene-Wenger-planning-summer-move-for-Toulouse-midfielder-Etienne-Capoue.html …

 Man City worse than poor, as Mancini said but that had been coming for Southampton. Better than Man U, Everton and Arsenal in recent games 
Think we can predict most of Arsenal's team v Munich from today's line-up. Main question will be if Giroud stays in. Think he'll be benched
 Poss Arsenal team v Munich (4-3-3): Szczesny; Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Vermaelen; Ramsey, Arteta, Wilshere; Walcott, Podolski, Cazorla

Got a lot of stick on saturday for saying Ramsey would come in for Giroud but he starts... Slightly more secure feel to arsenal midfield
Already feels like this could be damage limitation for Arsenal. They will do well to keep the tie alive tonight
 Away from the Arsenal inquest, Bayern look like a team up with Barca, Real and Man U as tournament favourites 
Javi Martinez was briefly a transfer target of Arsenal..then Bayern paid £34m for him last summer. Looks worth it

Arsenal to join European superpowers financially - and why Wenger will lead them into new era ://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/10104877/Arsenal-preparing-to-join-European-superpowers-with-70m-boost-says-chief-executive-Ivan-Gazidis.html …
Possible Higuain move gathers pace at Arsenal. Story here: ://bit.ly/198EbUZ 
Isco to Real also has positive knock-ons for Arsenal/Spurs. Bale bid much less likely this year and should speed up Higuain deal
 On Higuain to arsenal, deal agreed in principle with player and club. But Real stalling on signing it off b4 new manager's in place 
@MDemmayy Juve are also interested and things can always change but sense Arsenal are pretty confident
Further good news for Arsenal on Higuain - Juve have agreed a £10m deal with Man City for Tevez. Juve were in for Higuain #afc #mcfc
Julio Cesar in Arsenal's sights as Wenger considers adding some experienced back-up to Szczesny/Fabianski ://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/10149507/Arsenal-keen-on-signing-Queens-Park-Rangers-and-Brazil-goalkeeper-Julio-Cesar.html …
 Cech also said of Arsenal:   They are under pressure. The manager is under pressure. They will want to show they mean what they say.   
 In response to Higuain questions, he's still top target, Arsenal still quietly confident and there's still 8 days b4 they fly to asia 
 Higuain's dad now quoted by media both in Spain and Argentina saying the same:   We have permission to speak to Arsenal.   #afc 
 Almost identical transfer fees, so are Arsenal better placed by effectively trading Van Persie (30 next month) for Higuain (25)? 
 View from Arsenal (and Wenger) is that Fabregas unlikely to leave Barca for anyone, making their buy-back option a non-starter 
Being told Arsenal have received no bid for Cazorla and he wouldn't be sold at any price

Bernard won't be coming to Arsenal but club are still very much in for Suarez #lfc #afc
Arsenal have offered £40m plus £1 for Luis Suarez #lfc #afc...
Lots of people seem to think Arsenal are stupid in transfer market. Think frustrating is a better word..1/3
Arsenal expect Luis Suarez to tell Liverpool today that he wants to leave and join them #afc #lfc
Arsenal also share apparent belief of Suarez camp that there is more to clause than simply informing him of offer #lfc #afc
@MattHughesTimes agreed...risky to abandon higuain. What about Rooney option? He might want chelsea but man u may prefer arsenal
Arsenal and why they must combine negotiating savvy with added wealth at this pivotal moment..#afc://bit.ly/1c4YdQf 
Higuain booed every time he touches the ball at Arsenal - even though he wanted to come and deal fell through over fee
Arsenal still retain an interest in Rooney...and Man U could be more willing to sell to them than Chelsea #afc #mufc #cfc
 Rooney most attracted by Chelsea, who have made the only two bids, but would consider Arsenal and is set on leaving 
Arsenal also hoping for progress on Suarez this week - they don't regard £40m+1 bid as dead yet #afc #lfc
 Hill-Wood i'view on arsenal website - great image of him puffing on cigar and calmly saying   never in doubt   when Arsenal won lge in '89

Capoue to Spurs also almost done. Arsenal had a bid rejected for him in January but didn't go back this summer. #afc #THFC
Some non-Suarez Arsenal news..other main priority is right-sided defender. Sagna seen as ready to play centre-back #AFC
Arsenal still hoping on Suarez and one last bid likely but also now looking at Rooney ://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/wayne-rooney/10234621/Wayne-Rooney-ready-for-England-as-Arsenal-rejoin-hunt-for-striker.html …
Arsenal also looking for right-sided defender.  Miquel loan to Leicester shows confidence in Sagna option at centre-back
Rooney obviously a long shot for Arsenal but could just be feasible if Man U adopt an anybody but Chelsea stance
Arsenal seem quietly confident on Gustavo...Lars Bender was 1st choice in holding midfield but they didn't go back for Capoue
Most striking is estimated cash balance. Arsenal: £154m. Rest of PL combined: £181m. At least £70m is available for transfers

 @bigdirtyjames @Matt_Law_SM Yes, in transfer fees, but Arsenal wage bill makes it pretty even if you add it all up 
Thanks for all the feedback on earlier analysis of Arsenal's summer. Here's link for last time: ://bit.ly/16fjRxT 
Worth also saying that Arsenal still confident there'll be transfer action before end of August.
 @RedForceRising think Mourinho would agree with that - he listed arsenal '04, chelsea '05 and Man U '07 as   magnificent   
 Told by a good source that Mike Ashley responded to Arsenal £10.2m bid for Cabaye by saying   which part of him do you want?   
Told Arsenal also in for Paul Pogba. Seems to be added urgency on midfielders after Arteta/Ox injuries
 Ramsey, Rosicky and Gibbs will all travel tomorrow for Arsenal. Sagna will have a test in the morning but club are hopeful 
Ramsey's energy been the difference so far. Good start from Arsenal without creating clear chances

Loved Wenger's response tonight when asked if Mata's dad had been invited by Arsenal: “No. I don't know. Maybe.”
Arsenal don't plan to bid for Mata in this window and Chelsea won't sell but plausible to think there's a longer term game
Arsenal bench flimsy but this XI can certainly beat Spurs: Szcz Sagna Koscielny Mert Gibbs Ramsey Wilshere Walcott Rosicky Cazorla Giroud

 Arsenal focus is on strikers/midfielders now. Told there are   lots of balls in the air  . Wonder where they will all land 
@pjbish @johncrossmirror not sure what john means...but we did discuss arsenal's transfer strategy!
 Arsenal going for Ozil, Di Maria and Abel Hernandez...back ups Ba and Draxler. Wenger seemed quite confident post-match 
Focus for Arsenal today is midfielder/strikers. Wenger happy with his defence
Transfer record fee between Arsenal and Real Madrid agreed...now down to Mesut Ozil who is in Germany.
Amazing to think Arsenal transfer record is £15m for Arshavin...would be nearly trebled for Ozil. Still down to player to agree
 Arsenal have representatives in Germany to try and tie up Ozil deal. Fee agreed, now personal terms and medical to do 
 Arsenal also now have a deal in place for Emiliano Viviano, the Palermo and Italy goalkeeper. Seen as backup to Szczesny 
 Arsenal are confident personal terms will be OK for Mesut Ozil but after summer they have had, nothing being taken for granted 
 With Mesut Ozil close to completion, Arsenal are not now pursuing Angel di Maria #afc 
 On top of Ozil and Viviano, Arsenal are chasing one other deal. Have to assume it's a striker....#AFC 
Other Arsenal target surely a striker....have been enquiries for Abel Hernandez and Demba Ba. Late bid for Suarez/Rooney anyone?
 Looking like Ozil, Viviano and Ba on season long loan for Arsenal...but still 11 hours to go #AFC 
 With Arsenal going for Ozil, Viviano and Ba, you can follow all the deadline day developments here: ://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfers/9511033/Transfer-deadline-day-live.html … 
 Assists in last three seasons:
Ozil for Madrid/Germany: 94
Fabregas for Barca/Arsenal/Spain: 49
#afc 
No incomings expected at Chelsea and it is not just Arsenal in for Demba Ba -  will depend who meets terms and what Ba wants #AFC
 Chelsea, though, have no issue letting Ba go to a rival in Arsenal. Depends purely on who meets their terms 
German newspaper Bild reporting that Ozil to Arsenal will be confirmed within an hour #AFC
@BluesChronicle Financial doping related to spending more than you earn. Arsenal have the money for Ozil from their own revenues
Ozil to Arsenal is close but doubt it will be announced within an hour. Contracts currently with lawyers #AFC
 With Mesut Ozil to Arsenal almost done, talks for Emiliano Viviano are also progressing and deal should be announced shortly #afc 
Arsenal's signing of Ozil would not only break their own transfer record but also beat the record fees of both Manchester clubs
No issues on Ozil - Arsenal putting together statement and lawyers reading and re-reading contract. It's all agreed and medical done
Demba Ba to Arsenal has fallen through. Chelsea don't want to loan to a rival. #afc #cfc
Arsenal not now expecting to add a striker. Leaves club relying heavily on Giroud to feed off Ozil's assists #afc
Nicklas Bendtner will stay at Arsenal. Suggests Wenger does see him as an option now he can't get another striker. #afc #cpfc

 Arsenal's bench a big worry tonight. Miyachi, Akpom and Hayden have played a combined 1 min for club in Prem Lge 
It's 10 away wins in a row for Arsenal as Ramsey shines again ://bit.ly/19hYIC6 
 Also met Kroenke in St Louis two years ago. My impressions? He loves Wenger, its nonsense to think he's not passionate about arsenal...

No doubt who the main man is at Arsenal now. Wilshere benched. Ramsey shunted right. Rosicky shunted left. Ozil centre stage
 Arsenal a blur of brilliance, as they were at Swansea for periods. A long long way to go but comparable to the best AW teams at the moment 
One question is Jack Wilshere's place although probably suits Wilshere and Arsenal just now that team are no longer so reliant on him

Feeling was you can get away with 4-4-2 vs Stoke at home but not Arsenal away. Wilshere/Arteta/Rosicky v Bentaleb/Dembele not a fair fight

Ramsey and Arteta back for Arsenal tomorrow but Wilshere likely to be out with ankle injury #afc
Yesterday was a seismic moment for Arsenal - and the result of 10+yrs planning. Here's why: ://fw.to/AUIMl1F  #afc
Arsenal in contact with Schalke over Draxler but feeling at #afc is almost £40m should get you a finished product. Ozil was seen as that
Situation can change but no real expectation at Arsenal or Schalke of Draxler deal tomorrow.
 Arsenal looking to loan options, including Tello and Klose. Poss Draxler deal stalling on fee ... Story here: ://bit.ly/1loF570  
Arsenal priority now is as much in midfield as striker after Ramsey injury/Flamini ban. Hard also to count on Ox/Wilshere given recent probs
Kim Kallstrom definitely a deal Arsenal are working on...seen as someone with experience who can provide short-term solution #afc
 Expectation is that Kim Kallstrom will be only Arsenal arrival today. Situation could, of course, change but seeming unlikely #afc 
No change at Arsenal...Kim Kallstrom to be only signing unless there are unexpected changes. No push for Klose
Arsenal's thinking goes s'thing like this (1/2): Only ever looking for a striker better than Giroud/Bendtner unless injuries changed things
Kallstrom deal imminent. Then Arsenal expect to be closed for business. No late moves for Kalou/Klose #AFC

Point about Sanogo and Ox is mobility. Arsenal's attack was static against Man U. Wenger trying to give Ozil/Cazorla options
 Final points on Ozil, great player and final judgment can't come this yr. Problem is, Arsenal crave delivery now and that could affect him.. 
Funny night. Left Arsenal feeling more sure they will last distance in PL title race after performance of Ox and emergence of Sanogo but....
Ozil also adamant he will deliver and won't hide at Arsenal but hopes people will understand he's in period of transition #AFC
The point is that Arsenal are very very vulnerable down their left with Podolski on the pitch. If he gets a chance though...
 Out of 999 matches for Arsenal, today was Wenger's 43rd north London derby. He has only lost 6 of those matches #afc

If any two statistics sum up the debate about Arsene Wenger and his achievements at Arsenal it is these next two...
 Before Wenger, Arsenal recorded 23 top four finishes in 92 seasons. They are about to make it 18 out of 18 under him....#Wenger1000 
Arsenal also waiting on assessment to Laurent Koscielny's calf. Came off as a precaution at half-time on Saturday
Arsenal appeal on Gibbs will be a formality. They also hope to clear Ox on grounds that shot wasn't going wide. Decision tomorrow
 6-3, 6-0. Arsenal's scores at City and Chelsea look more like a Serena Williams 1st rounder at Wim'don: Match report: ://tinyurl.com/o9q7s9l

Things can change but sense at Arsenal is that likely to be quiet day. Maybe c-back cover but major striker signing looking unlikely #afc
 Yes, Arsene Wenger is involved in 'Match of Peace' in Rome today. But if Arsenal don't do major deals today that won't be the reason... 
One Arsenal deal that is close is Ignasi Miquel to Norwich. Only played 8 PL games in 3 yrs but still another c-back option to go...
 Arsenal been sounded out over Jermain Defoe, as reported by @Matt_Law_DT ... 
... But my info is that there's no interest from Arsenal in taking Defoe even on a short-term loan
 Still not expecting major incomings at Arsenal. As well as Miquel to Norwich, Arsenal likely to let Ryo Miyaichi join Feyenoord today 
 Arsenal working on one deal. Interest in Welbeck but Utd would prefer he joins Spurs. Miyaichi, Miquel and Coquelin all likely to leave 
Arsenal still in talks with Man U over Danny Welbeck and hoping to get deal done in next 2 hrs

 As long as no late hitches on Mustafi/Lucas, that should be it for ins at Arsenal but could be some interesting outs still 
 Early days but, so far this afternoon, Xhaka looking like the central midfielder that Arsenal have needed for about 10 years

Fulham v Arsenal today for me. Report in tomorrow's Sunday Telegraph...
@Youaremygooners  I've no idea who you are and why you are so angry and abusive. The Arsenal story will develop but you need to calm down.
 Have dipped back into Twitter and, yes, I know its important to update on the Arsenal takeover story I did. I work on it every day. 
 @TruroBlue Martins never joined Arsenal, as you know. But they spoke to him, as you probably don't know. Sorry you are so angry. 
Was at #AFC #EFC today. Felt like a very big win for Arsenal and also a recognition of the importance of the FA Cup. Great cup tie.

As reported by Telegraph Sport on Saturday Sunderland offered £2m loan fee for Carl Jenkinson. Hard for Arsenal to refuse. Blow to West Ham
@Mikey75Mp @TerryGladden Arsenal will not sell Jenkinson.
@snowbiggee @TeleFootball Would agree. Was there for Wilshere's debut for Arsenal + thought best England midfielder I had seen Gascoigne
But evidently Arsenal fans simply simply think I don't like Wilshere. Link won't work which is frustrating..I saw him debut. Brilliant.
Expect Petr Cech to Arsenal to be done this week. Neither club confirming but moving towards agreement it seems.
 Still can't quite believe CFC are letting Cech join Arsenal but, if happens,  shows Abramovich is man of his word. Has huge regard for Cech 
If (when) Cech joins Arsenal  expect Christophe Lollichon to go with him as gk coach. The pair are v close + Courtois may want his own man
Petr Cech from Chelsea to Arsenal for £11m should be announced on Monday. All agreed. Still can't quite believe that one is happening.

On Radio Five Live Sportsweek show from 9-11am for start of new season and then on to Arsenal v West Ham United..
At Arsenal v West Ham. Looking forward to see whether Arsenal can put down a marker.. but also how Payet + Reece Oxford (still just 16) cope
1-0 West Ham at h-t at Arsenal. Cech will be blamed. Maybe a bit harsh but if he comes he has to get. Good half. Good intent from West Ham
F-T: 0-2. Brilliant win for West Ham at the Emirates. Payet and Oxford (95pc pass accuracy) outstanding. Reality Cech for Arsenal...
I'm surprised  that Wenger has left out Oxlade-Chamberlain at Crystal Palace. He's been Arsenal's best player in last 2 matches!
That deal was done then West Ham pulled out after beating Arsenal. But then Ade on £110k a week.. s://twitter.com/i_spye_0/status/634856818141999104 …
At Arsenal v Liverpool. Both teams hit by injuries... wonder if Benteke can get at the Arsenal central defensive partnership.
 H-t: Cech (Sorry, Arsenal) 0 Liverpool 0. Ramsey goal should have stood but just how did Liverpool not score.. 
Arsenal will face Bayern Munich in Group F!
Safe to say Man Utd (PSV) and Chelsea (Porto) will be happiest so far... Man City (Juventus - Pogba?) and Arsenal (Bayern Munich) not so..
Arsenal - Bayern Munich and now Olympiakos. A bit better for them..
 Arsenal: Dinamo Zagreb, Bayern Munich, Olympiakos 
 That's a tough draw for Man City (again). Sting in tale for Man Utd with Wolfsburg but they, Arsenal + Chelsea should be happier.

 Bilic has won at Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City in West Ham's first 3 away games. That is utterly remarkable. No fluke either 
Spurs v Arsenal tonight.. both have put out strong teams here at White Hart Lane..
Incredible winning goal by Flamini. Good win for Arsenal. Criticism of Kane unfounded. He will be fine for Spurs
Been out doing an interview. Got back to catch up with Arsenal. No sense in Wenger leaving out Cech. Without being rude just plain stupid
Nothing Ospina can do with that but 59 secs between Arsenal equaliser and that is unforgivable.
Arsenal no points. And home and away v Bayern to come now. Blimey they have made a mess of this. What does Wenger have to say?
Arsenal and Chelsea losing in Champions League tonight. Without standing on ceremony this is piss poor..
On way to Man Utd v Wolfsburg. Hopefully Utd and City can fair better than the London clubs. Still can't believe Arsenal's performance

Suspect that win v Arsenal is proving a huge life raft for Mourinho right now. But last time he challenged Chelsea to sack him...
At Arsenal v Man Utd. Looks like Darmian back to rb to cope with Sanchez and Young at lb for Man Utd. Interested to see how Walcott fares.
And Sanchez scores.. 1-0 Arsenal
 3-0 FT. Brilliant from Arsenal. Brittle from Man Utd. Strange, unpredictable season this.. 
 Very, very impressive from Arsenal. Set the standard now. But not playing Schneiderlin a bad decision by Van Gaal 
 Huge win for Arsenal over a brilliant Bayern Munich. They really, really wanted that.

At Olympiakos v Arsenal.. would suggest Arsenal just keeping giving the ball to Ozil and they can definitely do this. 0-1.
0-2 Arsenal. One more goal and Olympiakos have to score 3. Arsenal need to keep attacking and they can kill this off
0-3 and surely Arsenal through. Remarkable stuff. They would have to concede three times now to go out..

PSG trying to get Marco Verratti red card against Arsenal over-turned but not heard yet if they have been successful
 Liverpool have beaten Arsenal and Chelsea away, drawn away at Spurs and beaten Leicester at home. That's a strong start to the season. 
At Nottingham Forest v Arsenal... where the visitors have made just the 11 changes pic.twitter.com/RRP7P7yZU9
Just the three changes for Forest (v Arsenal) including a first start for Nicklas Bendtner
Very much enjoyed Arsenal's performance tonight. Made 11 changes and put away a potentially dangerous tie away to Nottingham Forest 4-0.
At Arsenal v Spurs. Spurs have gone 3 at the back. Alli out with knee hurt in training. Should be ok for England duty but not certain.
PSG furious that Serge Aurier has had his visa revoked by UK authorities and cannot play against Arsenal. Story on @TeleFootball soon..
Uefa also expected to issue a statement in support of PSG and Serge Aurier after he had his visa revoked and cannot play against Arsenal
At Emirates where Watford are deservedly 2-0 up and Arsenal appalling. Only consolation is they have a lot of time...
H-T: Arsenal 0 Watford 2. And it should be even more for Watford. A lot of booing..
Arsenal back in it. Iwobi goal. Still  lots of time left..
 FT: Arsenal 1-2 Watford. Deserved win by Watford; poor from Arsenal. Big opportunity lost, maybe. 
What's so odd about Wenger's 'mentally ready' comment is that Watford were not direct or physical. They just outplayed Arsenal in first-half
At Bayern Munich v Arsenal. Thomas Muller on the bench... pic.twitter.com/ab42XGAZG4
 Arsenal been abysmal second-half. Lack of leaders... and Kieran Gibbs is now captain. One goal back, though, and there is hope?! 
Bayern 5 Arsenal 1 FT. Arsenal so bad that even the PA announcer was laughing as he read out the score after the fifth goal.
Spoken to a few people today + definitely get the sense that if Arsene Wenger leaves Arsenal this summer he still wants to carry on working
It happens time and time again but it is incredible how poor Arsenal are in these kind of games.
Feels like Groundhog Day in every sense for Arsenal. Unfortunately has to be Wenger's season. Do not buy 'there's no alternative' argument
Apparently the Arsenal 'stats' showed Sanchez was not as effective/ working for the team of late. The stats were wrong. Big call by Wenger
Not in business of knocking down stories but told no chance at all Wenger has been offered PSG job. Everyone expects him to stay at Arsenal
 Up until those defeats away to Everton and Man City in Dec, Arsenal were averaging 2.27 points/ league match. Since then it's 1.33 points. 
At Arsenal v Man City where some horrendous defending (again) and calm finishing has seen City take an early lead. 0-1.
Shocking defending and good finishing at the other end and it's Arsenal 1- City
One of the major reasons Lacazette is unlikely to want to join Arsenal is the balls-up they made trying to sign him last year
 Alisher Usmanov has made a bid to buy out Stan Kroenke at Arsenal as per Financial Times report. Not expected to go anywhere, however 
At Arsenal... 1-0 up but Koscielny just sent off.
2-0 Arsenal. Everton a shambles here
Arsenal fans booing Enner Valencia as he is substituted for the heinous crime of being fouled by Koscielny who deserved his sending off
Wenger doesn't talk like a man who is definitely staying at Arsenal.
Well done Arsenal. Superb display to win the FA Cup yet again. Excellent all over the pitch. Chelsea strangely flat
Told Monaco have rejected 3 bids for Mbappe already this summer including from Real Madrid and Arsenal. They keep saying he's not for sale.
Interesting that Port Adelaide say they will have a partnership with Arsenal as part of this. Talk of both being involved in China.. s://twitter.com/PAFC/status/876691684884570112 …
My understanding of Arsenal is that little can be done without sorting out Sanchez and Ozil. It's causing a lot of frustration
Arsenal want both Sanchez and Ozil to stay but little appears to be moving without that being sorted. Lacazette remains top target.
Said that Lacazette was Arsenal's no1 transfer target which is true. But main aim is keeping Sanchez/ Ozil and that's complicating matters.
Was told weeks ago that Monaco will not sell Bakayoko and Lemar in same window. So Chelsea's Bakayoko deal may kill Arsenal's Lemar chances
Appears this may get done early next week. Arsenal close on Lacazette. s://twitter.com/telefootball/status/880812109726179328 …
Sounds like Lacazette to Arsenal should get done. Just 4m euros apart in negotiations now. Could be a twist but appears likely.
Hope is now that Arsenal can agree Lacazette deal on Monday.  As previously reported little chance that they will get Lemar from Monaco.
Now told Lacazette will probably sign for Arsenal this weekend.

Arsenal thought to be in for Chris Smalling from Fulham. Man United also keen though.
Stefan Savic completing a trial at Arsenal today. Wenger is keen but have you heard of him?!
Arsenal are basically playing in Hull's penalty area but not actually shooting. Still the best part of ten minutes to find a way through.
Full time 2-1. Vital win that puts Arsenal second at least until Man United play Fulham tomorrow.
Post match interviews then over the Humber Bridge and back down south. Next Arsenal game - West Ham at home 20th March.
Diaby on Arsenal facing 'disgraceful' physical approach from other Premier League teams in today's Standard
 Arsenal to play Barcelona, Man United v Bayern. Latest column ( alittle late) below. 
 Wenger wont be happy Arsenal are at home first. Club secretary David Miles   Its not the draw we would have wanted...but we owe Barca one.   
Early goal from Denilson- a lovely finish by the way- has settled arsenal into a good rhythm.
 Franco off, Cole on for West Ham. Diaby on for Bendtner for Arsenal. 
Arshavin playing through the middle on his own for Arsenal. Tense atmosphere here now. Cole up top with Mido.
 Arsenal have more of a footing in the game now and seemed to have quietened the Hammers. For now, at least. 
A shade over 24 minutes remaining at the Emirates. Arsenal look more likely to score. Mark Noble about to come on.
 Incidentally, I believe Vermaelen's sending off is Arsenal first red card of the Premier League season. Noble on for Kovac. 
Penalty to Arsenal
Upson handled Fabregas's chipped pass through. No second yellow so he stays on. Fabregas to take pen and surely put Arsenal top of the PL.
Hugely spirited display this from Arsenal - have overcome the odds again. West Ham have been poor though against ten men.
The penalty was very similar to the late one Arsenal got at Stoke a few weeks back. Chipped up onto Upson's hand.
2-0 Full time. Arsenal go top with Man United playing Liverpool and Blackburn hosting Chelsea tomorrow.
 All in all, a decent weekend for Arsenal. They stay about Chelsea after their draw at Blackburn. Roll on Birmingham. 
Away fans bowing before him. Eight goals in a week for Messi - effortless finish. Arsenal have been warned.
No decision expected on Vermaelen's red card appeal until this afternoon. Arsenal have until 1pm to submit their evidence.
Spoke to Wenger this morning who insists Arsenal won't break their contract principles to keep Gallas at the club.
Read an exclusive interview with Gael Clichy on Arsenal's first return to Birmingham since Eduardo's injury in tomorrow's Standard.
Just received my player access sticker from the fabulous Arsenal press officer who is absolutely not reading this over my shoulder. #Arsenal
 Apparently I need to add #Arsenal to every tweet so people can find me. Personally, I find it a little annoying. 
Campbell heads over from Fabregas's corner. Arsenal enjoying a bit more of the ball now.
Not really seen enough from Arsenal in the opening period. How long before Arshavin and Nasri come on? Fabregas still looks shaken.
Rosicky fires miles over. Surely its time for the cavalry now. Was that miss the little bit of luck Arsenal needed?
Arsenal just starting to crank it up a little here. Free-kick for foul on Rosicky.
8 minutes plus stoppages for Arsenal to hold on. Kevin Phillips is coming on for Fahey.
 Nasri in, tried to square it rather than shoot (classic Arsenal). Ball hacked clear. 
Arsenal plrobably didnt do enough on balance to win the game but to drop two points like that is a sickener.
At Arsenal training ground and Cesc is not training with the rest of the squad. Must be a major doubt for tomorrow now.
Fabregas starts for Arsenal - Wenger is going to risk him it would appear.
Arsenal at full strength (side from RVP) - only time will tell how big a gamble it is to play Gallas and Fabregas.
Barca dominating the ball early on - Arsenal look set to play on the counter attack.
Arsenal cannot get a foothold in the game and they are very lucky not to be behind already.
All hands to the pump for Arsenal - quite incredible how they are not behind. Could easily be 4-0 down. Crowd are both agitated and scared.
#Arsenal warming to the task. Nasri shoots just wide. 23 minutes before their first shot on goal. #Barcelona
 Eboue finally comes on, Arshavin off straight down the tunnel. Messi goes over in the box under Clichy's tackle. Nothing doing. #Arsenal 
 Barca are a touch less dominant, only a touch, but Arsenal simply cannot hold onto the ball for long enough to create anything meaningful. 
 Gallas off on stretcher, Arsenal playing with ten temporarily. 
 The goal has stirred Arsenal into life a little but the more they committ, the more Barca can break. We're set up for an enthralling end. 
Arsenal need a miracle now. The Emirates is decidedly subdued.
Barca playing with total authority now. Walcott about to come on for Arsenal 24 minutes left.
 Pique upends Fabregas on edge of the box. The Barca defender is out of the second leg, dangerous position for #Arsenal. 
Over the bar. But much better from Arsenal generally - 17 minutes to go.
 Penalty to Arsenal, red card for Puyol 
Very fortunate for Arsenal.
He is going to have to go off. Arsenal playing with ten. Milito on for Messi.
2-2 full time. Will feel like a victory for Arsenal. Somehow they are still in the tie.
Chelsea get a vital win at United. Great news for Arsenal too. Beat Wolves and its game on again...
Bendtner pulls it out at the death for Arsenal! 1-0 full time. The title is still on. Roll on Tuesday.
I will be giving live updates tonight from the Nou Camp so look out for that from around 7pm. #Arsenal #Barcelona
Arsenal fans are up in the gods. Insanely high up there. The Camp Nou pitch is sunk below ground level but no-one can tell me how far.
 Reasonable start this from Arsenal, considering. They havent had much of the ball but Barca have not really opened them up. Yet. 
Bendtner 0-1 Arsenal!!!!!!!!!!
It is a breathtaking sight to watch Messi run down that Barca right flank. Seems an inevitability about it but Arsenal survived.
3-1 Messi. He breaks the offside trap and dinks a stunning finish over Almunia. He's unstoppable and you fear for Arsenal now.
 A goal now would make it interesting. Remember, 3-3 would send Arsenal through. 
 Eboue on for Silvestre, who has had a miserable night and there is virtually no reception from the Arsenal fans up in the gods. 
Nice turn from Pedro but he drags his right foot show wide. 10 minutes + added time left for Arsenal to save their Champions League season.
So Arsenal are out of Europe for another yeat. No disgrace losing to this lot but the inquest over the depth of the squad will begin.
Read Manuel Almunia's thoughts on #Arsenal's Champions League exit to Barcelona first in Wednesday's London Evening Standard.
Chelsea go 4 points clear at top of PL with 1-0 win. Arsenal can reduce it to 3 if they beat Spurs tmw. You feel they simply have to now.
Arsenal team exactly as in todays Standard. I like it when that happens.
 OK. In position at WHL. Arsenal: Almunia, Sagna, Campbell, Vermaelen, Clichy; Nasri, Diaby, Denilson, Eboue, Bendtner, Rosicky. 
 Van Persie, Walcott and Eduardo among the subs for #arsenal, Bentley, Crouch and Gudjohnsen for #Tottenham 
Atmosphere building nicely at WHL. Arsenal players jeered at every touch in the warm uo.
Sol effort at goal from a corner stopped by Assou-Ekotto on the line. What a silencer that would have been for #Arsenal
 Bendtner drags a left foot half chance wide from just inside box. 27 mins gone, Arsenal created very little but are getting more of the ball 
Spurs playing on the break now as Arsenal monoplise the ball. Modric booked for foul on Sagna.
 Modric is in, momentarily, but Clichy and then Almunia do enough to snuff out the threat #Arsenal 
We're back underway with #Spurs leading #Arsenal 1-0. Massive 45 minutes in both clubs' seasons coming up.
 Defoe's pass finds Bale, who looks offside but Sagna is playing him on, and he sidefoots past Almunia. A mountain to climb now for #Arsenal 
 And its Sagna. Walcott on, Eboue switches to right-back. We have played 51 minutes and its #Spurs 2-0 #Arsenal 
Away fans are chanting RVP's name. They want the Dutchman on - big ask to salvage this for #Arsenal after five months out.
Vermaelen has taken a seat in the Arsenal dugout. He looks angry more than upset. Didnt limp either.
Fantastic volley from RVP brings an equally fantastic one-handed stop from Gomes. Rosicky's shot is deflected wide. #Arsenal getting closer.
Dangerous free-kick on edge of the box for Arsenal. Dawson is booked for clipping Diaby. RVP to take...
Its like they bhave won the League here. 11 years since they last beat #Arsenal.
So #Spurs close within one point of #ManCity in fourth while #Arsenal stay 6 points behind #Chelsea.
You have to say that is probably Arsenal's title bid over. But then #Chelsea won't fancy coming here after that so you never know...
Read Danny Rose and Heurelho Gomes's thoughts on #Spurs 2-1 win over #Arsenal in today's #London Evening #Standard.
Big chance for #Arsenal to close the gap at #Wigan tomorrow after Chelsea's loss. My train gets in at 12.30 so expect updates from 1pm.
 #Arsenal: Fabianski; Sagna, Campbell, Vermaelen, Clichy; Nasri, Eastmond, Diaby; Walcott, Bendtner, Rosicky. 
 #Wigan are lined up 4-2-3-1 with Moreno supported by N'Zogbia, Watson and #Rodallega, #Arsenal their customary 4-3-3. 
 Quiet start. #Campbell, captaining the side for the first time since returning to #Arsenal, has already made two decent interceptions. 
 Arsenal free-kick on the edge of the box after a foul on #Walcott. Clichy and Nasri lining it up, left of centre, 25 yards out. 
Diame is caught in possession by Diaby and he hauls back the Arsenal midfielder to earn the first yellow card. The locals are unimpressed.
#Arsenal showing signs of finding some sort of rhythm. Better possession now and Rosicky warms #Kirkland's hands from 20 yards out.
Yep SIlvestre doubles Arsenal's lead with three minutes of the second half gone. You have to think thats game over now.
#Wigan have never beaten #Arsenal in the #PremierLeague and that doesn't look like changing today. No confidence at all in the final third.
There seems to be some furore about a Wigan penalty appeal before Arsenal got their 2nd. Nasri pulled back Watson but went down very easily.
#Wigan get in down the left and the ball is cut back to Watson who sidefoots home from 12 yards out. #Arsenal were carved open there.
That may just stir #Arsenal into life as it has been a dismal second half as a spectacle.
#Wenger will probably tear his own face off if #Arsenal somehow contrive to throw this away.
Merida and Eboue have come on for Rosicky and Walcott. Surely #Arsenal just need to keep the ball now and run down the clock?!
Watson's header is cleared off the line!!! I think it was Sagna. Its mayhem in the Arsenal box now. Another Wigan corner.
Arsenal have gone to pieces. The DW Stadium is rocking. I clearly know nothing about this game - who could have seen this coming?
Wigan's first ever PL win over Arsenal is confirmed. Full-time.
 I will now attempt to speak to an #Arsenal player. Yeah, I dont hold out much hope. 
#Clichy tells today's #LondonEveningStandard he is happy at #Arsenal despite reports linking #Barcelona with a £10m summer bid.
Spoken to #Wenger today - and he warned #Adebayor that #Arsenal are the club that made him but forgives him for his celebration in September
Another late show from #ManUnited. Pressure on #Chelsea now - live updates from #Arsenal v #ManCity from 5pm.
 We're underway. Arsenal: Fabianski, Sagna, Sol, Silvestre, Clichy, Song, Nasri, Diaby, Walcott, Van Persie, Rosicky. 
 Ten gone, scrappy and disjointed from both. #Arsenal with more of the ball but nothing created of note at either end yet. 
#City look happy to take a 0-0 home with them and are committing few men forward. #Arsenal still look shellshocked from #Wigan.
#Arsenal just havent looked like breaking City down. #Bellamy is booked for crunching tackle on #Bendtner.
 Relatively speaking in a very quiet game, Arsenal are mounting a little concerted pressure here. RVP to deliver another fk from out wide 
 Cleared but Arsenal keep the ball, RVP twists and turns in the box but can find no space. #City scramble it clear again. 
 At the risk of tempting fate, I think we could have another 88 minutes here and not see a goal. Arsenal fans starting to file out. 
 Full time 0-0. Dire game, 2nd half marginally better than the first. That mathematically ends #Arsenal's title bid, City 1pt behind #Spurs. 
 #Arsenal confirm #ACMilan, #Lyon and #Celtic all to play at Emirates Cup in last weekend of July. 
Arrived at #Emirates for #Wenger press conference. Very low media turnout - dead game for #Arsenal. Everyone must be gearing up for #Fulham.
 Could be 4-4-2, not played that way for ages though. #Walcott and #VanPersie up front for #Arsenal? Maybe not. Pies in the press room. 
Notable for #Arsenal fans this - #Johan #Djourou on the bench since a knee cartilage injury suffered in August.
Pretty chilly up here in the stands. Teams are out warming up. #Blackburn perhaps slightly more vigorously than #Arsenal.
Women's FA Cup Final 2-2 between #Arsenal and #Everton - apparently only one journalist turned up to the pre-match Arsenal presser on Thurs.
The mascots scamper off as the teams come out. Looks like #VanPersie has the armband for #Arsenal. We'll be underway imminently.
 Corner flicked on by Diaby and Van Persie escapes Givet to score a header, yes a header, with 14 minutes played. 1-0 #Arsenal. 
 If #Blackburn hang onto this result, they will go 10th in the Premier League. And #Spurs could still catch #Arsenal for 3rd... 
 2 mins plus stoppages left for #Arsenal to salvage anything. It doesnt look that likely at the moment, I have to say. Attendance: 26,138 
Full time 2-1 Blackburn. #Arsenal's players trudge off the pitch. Let the wave of #Fabianski abuse begin. I wonder if he will want to talk..
If you are wondering why #Wenger has not spoken today - he has a sore throat apparently so no #Arsenal press conference today
 Seems a bit weak if you ask me. Why Pat Rice couldn't do it, or for that matter an #Arsenal player, is beyond me. Poor way to end the season 
 Arsenal: Fabianski, Sagna, Campbell, Silvestre, Clichy; Eboue, Diaby, Nasri; Walcott, Van Persie (c), Arshavin. 
 So, #Arsenal win and they guarantee 3rd but a defeat would let #Tottenham in if they beat #Burnley. Surely it can't happen?!?! 
 A few ironic cheers ring out from the home fans as #Fabianski claims a cross. Bad form, that, from the #Arsenal fans. 
Arshavin 1-0 Arsenal
3-0 Arsenal own goal (Baird). The defender turns in #Walcott's cross after #Eboue fails with a backflick.  Comically bad.
3-0 to Arsenal at half-time. Easy as you like. Its a question of how many they want in the second half.
 #Fulham fans singing   we're going to Germany   and the #Arsenal fans applaud them. Nice - the Fabianski baiting has stopped too. 
#Djourou comes on for #Arsenal to warm applause. His first appearance of the season. Silvestre goes off - could be his last for the club.
Arsenal 4-0 (Vela). Delightful little flick over Schwarzer after being put in by Nasri. Lovely finish.
#Arsenal players are coming back out for a lap of appreciation...
Read #RobinvanPersie's thoughts on #Arsenal's season first in tomorrow's #LondonEveningStandard
Fran #Merida leaves #Arsenal and returns to #Atletico Madrid. Not a great surprise that but another minor blow to #Wenger.
#Arsenal thought to have made a £4m offer for #Lorient centre-back Laurent #Koscielny. Club are holding out for £7m though.
#Barca make formal offer to #Arsenal for #Fabregas. Likely to be rejected as its only an opening negotating position.
#Fabregas offer understood to be £30m and set to be rejected by #Arsenal...
#Arsenal set to step up interest in #Koscielny. My money would be on him joining the #Gunners by the end of the #worldcup
#Koscielny thought to have nearly agreed personal terms over #Arsenal move - clubs haggling over the fee but almost a done deal.
#Lorient set to sign defender Bruno Manga paving the way for Arsenal to land #Koscielny. Deal to go through this week once price agreed.
As I said earlier in week (bit of shameless self-promotion) #Arsenal complete signing of #Koscielny for total fee of £10m. Should wear No6.
I'd be surprised if Shaun Wright-Phillips ends up at #Arsenal as reported this morning. They don't need him and would be end of Theo.
 Looks like #Almunia's time at #Arsenal could be up. #Wenger:   He gets nervous on big matches, thereby making silly mistakes.   See ya, Manuel 
 Some controversy over #Wenger interview with Kenyan paper I mentioned earlier. #Arsenal says quotes are inaccurate, Kenyans say its legit. 
Reports in #esp suggest #Barcelona have set Friday deadline to reach agreement with #Arsenal over #Fabregas. Gunners holding out for £50m+.
#Eduardo agrees £6m move to #Shakhtar after assurances from #Croatia coach #Bilic his international career wouldn't be affected. #arsenal
#VanPersie to wear No10 at #Arsenal this season. He'll love that - following in the footsteps of his idol #Bergkamp.
#Wenger confident #Campbell will stay at #Arsenal for one more season - hasn't bought another centre-back yet for that reason.
#Eduardo issues personal messgae to #Arsenal fans - #Wenger says he won't sign a replacement striker.
Reports in #esp suggest #Fabregas has agreed personal terms over move to #Barcelona. #Arsenal may well have something to say about that...
#Sol Campbell reportedly having a medical at #Newcastle - would be quite a u-turn as he indicated to #Arsenal he would stay.
#Djourou went off injured in #Arsenal's friendly win last night but should be fit for Emirates Cup. #Bendner to miss start of season though.
Sources in Spain suggesting #Fabregas will tell #Wenger again this weekend that he wants to leave #Arsenal and join #Barcelona...
 At the #Emirates where #Arsenal and #Celtic are about to kick-off. Cloudy but mild day, sell-out in the stands and Queen on the PA system... 
#Vela slides the ball home after Walcott's scuffed centre. Awful defending from #Celtic and #Arsenal lead 1-0 here after 3 minutes.
#Celtic fans refusing to join the Mexican wave that is currently doing the rounds here. #Arsenal lead 1-0. Game is just ticking along.
 Arsenal 2-0 Celtic. Low left foot drive from Sagna, of all people, takes a slight deflection but goes straight through Zaluska in goal. H-T. 
Walcott slips a pass to Nasri who sidefoots it home from 16 yards. 3-0 Arsenal. Could be a cricket score this. Depends how bothered they are
 Arsenal 3-1 Celtic. Pinball in the #Arsenal penalty area and it falls to Murphy, who smashes it home. 
#Arsenal 3-2 #Celtic. #Fortune crossed for Ki #Sung-Yeung to slot the ball home. Impressive response this from Celtic. 7 mins left.
#Arsenal win 3-2 and retain #Emirates Cup. Insert your own joke about trophy drought here.

#Barcelona urged to call #Wenger's bluff over #Arsenal's refusal to sell #Fabregas in today's #LondonEveningStandard.
 In #Arsenal news, #Wenger failed to turn up for a charity event today because he was   in a meeting  . With Cesc perhaps? Or a centre-back? 
 #Fabregas statement expected some time this afternoon, although #Arsenal insist it is not a foregone conclusion there will be one. 
#Fabregas statement out - he'll stay put for now but could have been more forthcoming in his love for #Arsenal. #Barcelona next summer?
#Wenger seems set to sign new deal at #Arsenal. Probably confirmed during the international break next month.
 #Arsenal; #Sagna, #Vermaelen, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Nasri, #Diaby, #Wilshere, #Eboue, #Chamakh, #Arshavin (#Van Persie, #Walcott on bench). 
 #Arsenal far more composed in possession but creating little really. But then neither have #Liverpool. Could do with a goal, this. 
Joe Cole sent off! Went in late on #Koscielny. Its a bad one but a straight red looks a touch harsh. Stretcher for the #Arsenal lad though
 #Anfield is rocking now as #Arsenal, despite having an extra man, are on the back foot. A succession of corners. They need to survive this. 
#Rosicky's cross is headed wide by #Vermaelen. Difficult chance but #Arsenal have struggled to create anything clear cut.
 What's that? You have a big striker to come back in? Well, so do #Arsenal. #Van Persie is on for #Diaby as #Wenger goes for broke. 
#Rosicky is only denied an equaliser by a stunning save from #Reina - super football and easily the best chance #Arsenal have created.
 1-1. #Arsenal are level. Comical own goal. Chamakh's header comes back off the post and #Reina, trying to catch it, fumbles it into the net. 
Liverpool 1-1 Arsenal. Breathless second half and #Arsenal deserved a point for possession but #Reina gifted it. Two debutants sent off too.
#Nasri will be out for a month after undergoing knee surgery on an meniscal injury sustained during Sunday's draw with #Liverpool. #arsenal
#Fulham thought to be holding out for £4million for #Schwarzer. #Wenger won't pay that but #Arsenal have 12 days to negotiate.
Sebastien #Squillachi to undergo medical at #Arsenal on Monday ahead of move from Sevilla.
 #Redknapp says #Gallas signing is #Tottenham getting   one over   on #Arsenal. Also says #Spurs unlikely to sign another player this summer. 
 #Arsenal drawn to face #Shakhtar #Donetsk, #Braga and #FK Partisan - looks a good draw to me. 
Just got to Grove after #eng training. Arsenal young keeper James Shea in to make up numbers as Carson (back) and Foster (knee) are out.
#Arsenal thought to have made final offer for #Schwarzer. Up to #Fulham now - #Wenger relaxed - at #eng training talking to #Baldini.
#VanPersie out until mid-October. Big blow for #Arsenal. And for my fantasy football team.
Rumours #Walcott is out for up to six weeks after scan revealed ankle ligament damage. #Arsenal yet to confirm.
#Arsenal confirm #Walcott out for four to six weeks with ankle injury.
#Vermaelen out of #Arsenal's game against Bolton with an Achilles injury. Should be fit for #Braga.
#Arsenal lead 1-0. Penalty. #Chamakh brought down and #Fabregas slots it home. Easy as you like.
Sumptuous start from #Arsenal. Carving the visitors open at will. Second goal required but this is comfortable at present.
 #Arsenal 3-0 #Braga. #Chamakh finishes well from #Wilshere's flick. Could be a cricket score. Not one that's fixed, though (allegedly). 
#Arsenal 4-0 #Braga. They pick up where they left off. 53 minutes played #Arshavin crosses to #Fabregas who heads home. Easy.
 #Arsenal 5-0 #Braga. Delightful, delightful stuff. #Arshavin feeds the ball into #Vela who chips it over #Felipe. Wonderful. 
 #Arsenal 6-0 #Braga. #Fabregas, who has been superb, plays in #Vela who wrongfoots the keeper and rolls the ball inside the near post. 
 #Redknapp confirms #Pletikosa, #Bassong, #Palacios will all start for #Spurs against #Arsenal tomorrow. #Bentley, #Keane, #Hutton likely too 
 Stronger that expected #Arsenal team as #Rosicky, #Eboue, #Koscielny and #Wilshere start. #Pavlyuchenko and #Giovani for #Spurs. 
 #Tottenham 0-1 #Arsenal. #Wilshere crosses and the home defence is static, allowing #Lansbury to slide in for his first senior goal. 
Half time and its 1-0 #Arsenal. Dominated the half with an impressive display but Spurs are far too narrow and haven't got tactics right.
#Tottenham 1-1#Arsenal. Naughton plays in #Keane who breaks the offside trap to equalise. #Fabianski should do better.
#Arsenal dominate but can't find a winner. We'll have extra time at White Hart Lane. More signalling from Wenger.
#Tottenham 1-2 #Arsenal. Nasri scores from the penalty spot after being brought down by #Bassong. A touch harsh but probably right.
#Tottenham 1-3 #Arsenal. #Nasri scores another penalty after #Chamakh is brought down by #Caulker. He went down easily but contact made.
#Tottenham 1-4 #Arsenal. #arshavin is fouled but gets straight up as spurs switch off and smashes a left foot shot past pletikosa.

 #Arsenal team: Fabianski, Sagna, Djourou, Squillaci, Gibbs, Rosicky, Denilson, Song, Arshavin, Wilshere, Chamakh 
 Well, we are underway here but the floodlights are not fully on. Its got a kind of twilight feel to it. #Arsenal in yellow. 4-2-3-1. 
#Cleo is in behind the defence but #Arsenal get back in numbers to crowd him out. Incredible atmosphere here now.
 #Squillaci and #Fabianski nearly make a mess of a routine clearance. At the other end, signs #Arsenal are easing into the game, slowly. 
#Partizan 0-1 #Arsenal. #Arshavin gives the visitors the lead with a low drilled shot from just inside the area. Home fans seem oblivious.
 #Arshavin, #Rosicky and #Arshavin all have golden chances to make it 2-0. Free kick from Denilson hits wall. All #Arsenal now. 
#Partizan 1-1 #Arsenal. #Denilson is adjudged to have handled in the box and #Cleo easily beats #Fabianski. Game on.
#Arsenal still on top despite the equaliser. The edge has been taken off their play though as #Partizan have renewed hope.
 #Partizan 1-2 #Arsenal. A long cross from the right finds #Chamakh, whose first header is tipped onto the bar, but his second finds the net. 
#Partizan 1-3 #Arsenal. Game well and truly over. #Nasri swings over a corner from the left and #Squillachi scores.
Read #Fabianski on his heroics in #Arsenal's 3-1 win over #Partizan in Wednesday's #LondonEveningStandard.
Apparently there were 17 arrests last night- nothing to do with #Arsenal. Red Star lot came down to cause trouble with #Partizan fans.
#Chelsea 0-0 #Arsenal. #Arshavin just went close with a rasping drive. Even contest. Visitors giving as good as they get.
 #Chelsea 1-0 #Arsenal. Had to be that man #Drogba, who turns home Cole's cross. #Wenger furious about foul given in the build up. 
Back underway at the Bridge. #Arsenal on the front foot and they have to be. Big half for their confidence going forward now.
 Great game now. #Arsenal go close twice before #Squillaci gifts the ball to #Anelka, who rounds Fabianski but puts it wide. 
 Emmanuel-Thomas on for Arsenal. Wilshere off, a little surprisingly. Ten mins left. Chamakh misses glorious chance- heads wide. 
#Chelsea 2-0 #Arsenal. Koscielny fouls Anelka and Alex smashes the free kick into the top corner. Game over.
Full time. Arsenal fail to answer the same questions yet again. 7 pt gap now.
 #Fabregas also warns #Arsenal need to end their silverware drought soon:   I have everything at Arsenal, we just need to win titles.   
 Anyway, here at the the San Siro, #Spurs come out for their warm-up. The stadium screen is showing #Arsenal's goals from last night. Ironic. 
 Here at #City v #Arsenal- 5 mins in and #Boyata is sent off! Rightly, for a tackle on #Chamakh. He was last man. 
Super start - #Arsenal had been under the cosh but that red card has totally changed the game.
Man City 0-1 #Arsenal. Lovely move. #Nasri plays a give and go with #Arshavin and steers the ball high past #Hart. 20 mins gone.
Penalty to Arsenal.
 Man City 0-2 #Arsenal. #Bridge intercepts #Fabregas's pass for #Chamakh but gives it straight to Song, who stabs home. 
Man City 0-3 #Arsenal. Substitute #Bendtner opens up his body to curl one past Hart. Game over.
 Full time and although the early sending off helped, that was a thoroughly professional job from #Arsenal. Thought #Fabianski did well too. 
 #Arsenal: #Szczesny, #Eboue, #Koscielny, #Djourou, #Gibbs, #Eastmond, #Denilson, #Walcott, #Rosicky, #Vela; #Bendtner. 
Its >>20 for an adult ticket here at St James' Park tonight for #Newcastle v #Arsenal. Stadium set to be half full though.
Honestly could be 4-1 to #Arsenal already. #Walcott gets behind the defence but his cross is cleared before #Bendtner shoots just wide.
 #Newcastle 0-1 #Arsenal. Stoppage time corner headed goalwards by #Bendtner, it may have gone over the line before rebounding off #Krul. 
 #Newcastle 0-2 #Arsenal. And its controversial. #Walcott breaks through but #Bendtner, coming back from offside, blocks off nearest defender 
 #Newcastle giving it a decent go here but yet to muster a clear cut chance. Meanwhile, #Arsenal look dangerous on the break. 2-0, 80 played. 
 #Newcastle 0-3 #Arsenal. #Newcastle lose possession and #Fabregas finds #Bendtner, who hit a sweet effort into the top corner. Game over. 
#Newcastle 0-4 #Arsenal. #Walcott is played in and he speeds away from the defence and slots unerringly past #Krul. Comprehensive.
 Full-time 4-0 #Arsenal. #Szczesny makes a late save to earn a well deserved clean sheet. He was excellent, as was #Walcott, as were #Arsenal 
#Arsenal set to reject request from Wales to allow #Ramsey to play on Nov 17th. Sources claim he won't be fit until end of Nov.
 Been told #Wilshere's new contract at #Arsenal will be a five year deal taking his wages from £12,500-a-week to £50,000-a-week. 
#Celtic monitoring #Szczesny talks as he confirms delaying talks with #Arsenal over new five year deal.
Former #Arsenal and #Spurs scout/sporting director Damien #Comolli has left Saint-Etienne. Rumour has it he could be goiing to #Liverpool.
#Drogba apparently felt ill on the journey to Anfield. Shocking result for #Arsenal. Can Liverpool do them a favour?
 Arsenal (4-2-3-1): #Fabianski, #Sagna, #Djourou, #Squillaci, #Clichy, #Song, #Wilshere, #Nasri, #Fabregas, #Arshavin, #Chamakh. 
#Everton 0-1 #Arsenal. #Sagna smashes home from a tight angle after Nasri's shot was saved by Howard.
 #Arteta looks massively off the pace, it must be said, while #Coleman's early industry has petered out. #Arsenal in relative control. 
#Everton 0-2 #Arsenal. Superb goal. #Fabregas plays a one-two with #Chamakh and fires the return into the far corner. Brilliant.
#Everton 1-2 Arsenal. #Saha heads down Pienaar's corner and #Cahill is on hand to turn it home. We're into stoppage time.
#Everton 1-2 #Arsenal. Full time. #Arsenal survive a late barrage to take a derserved victory from Goodison Park.
#Wenger urges #Arsenal fans to respect #Gallas on his return to Emirates tomorrow. Fat chance...
Here at Emirates for #Arsenal v #Spurs. Frenetic start- #Gallas pumped up by captaincy. But then the #Arsenal fans know all about that...
 #Arsenal 1-0 #Tottenham. #Nasri, who has already exchanged unpleasantries with Gallas, beats Gomes to the ball and scores from a tight angle 
#Arsenal 2-0 #Tottenham. Lovely counter attack. Fabregas feeds #Arshavin who crosses for #Chamakh to turn home. #Gallas argues with the ref.
#Bentley gesturing towards the #Arsenal fans as he warms up. He is being provoked but he just can't resist it can he?
Half time. 2-0 #Arsenal. Bit better from Spurs before the break but Arsenal in truth could be out of sight. Gallas Spurs best player.
 #Arsenal 2-1 #Spurs. Long ball is won by #Defoe, VDV picks it up and feeds #Bale, who prods it past Fabianski. Game on. 
#Spurs formation switch has freed them up. #Modric fires just over and Arsenal are playing counter attack football on their own ground.
#Arsenal 2-2 #Tottenham. Fabregas idiotically jumps in the wall with his hand in the air. VDV's free kick strikes his hand. Pen. VDV scores.
#Squillaci has the ball in the net but the flag is rightly raised for offside. Fabregas then volleys over. Good response this from #Arsenal.
Crouch on for Pav. He scored for England in midweek. Can he do it again? Walcott imminent for Arsenal.
#Arsenal 2-3 #Tottenham. Oh my. Van der Vaart's free-kick is flicked home by #Kaboul. What a turnaround. 4 mins left.
#Arsenal 2-3 #Tottenham. Its over. First win here for Spurs since 1993. Switch to 4-4-2 the key. Arsenal couldn't handle it.
 Fantastic presser from #Arshavin.   #Arsenal cannot finish top of the group.     Defence isn't good enough- we try to improve but we can't.   
 OK. At #Emirates. Arsenal line up: Fabianski, Sagna, Squillaci, Koscielny, Gibbs, Nasri, Song, Denilson, Arshavin, van Persie, Chamakh 
Plenty of empty seats here at #Arsenal. Van Persie and Chamakh in starting line up but Van Persie playing in hole behind him.
 #Arsenal on top in opening stages but it is like a morgue out here at the moment, Handful of #Partizan fans making more noise. 
Penalty to #Arsenal
#Arsenal 1-0 #Partizan. #Van Persie scores from the spot after being brought down in the box. Looked soft but probably the right decision.
#Arsenal 1-1 #Partizan. Oh my. #Gunners defence stands off #Cleo and his shot deflects off #Squillaci and past #Fabianski.
 Delicately poised this. #Arsenal go through as it stands but if #Partizan score again or #Braga score in #Shakhtar (0-0 now), that changes. 
 #Arshavin, who was critical of the #Arsenal defence yesterday, has had a shocker and is replaced by #Walcott. 22 mins left. 
#Arsenal 2-1 #Partizan. #Walcott chests the ball down and volleys home after Sagna's cross isnt dealt with. They've been poor but now lead.
#Arsenal 3-1 #Partizan. #Song plays a one-two with #Bendtner and finds #Nasri who turns smartly and fires a left-foot shot past #Stojkovic.
#Sagna is sent off! Rightly so for fouling #Lazevski who had got goalside. #Arsenal manage to keep out the resultant free kick.
 Full time. 3-1. Van Persie:   As a football fan, I would like us to get #Barcelona.   Bet there are a few #Arsenal fans who disagree 
Read Theo #Walcott's thoughts on #Arsenal's Champions League chances first in Thursday's #EveningStandard.
 Got to Old Trafford. #Fergie in programme:   #Arsenal are not the lilywhites portrayed by their admirers. How many have they had sent off?   
#Chamakh handles in the area but referee #Webb says no penalty. Lucky escape there for #Arsenal.
#ManUtd 1-0 #Arsenal. #Nani's cross is deflected towards #Park who somehow angles a header in off the post.
 1-0 United HT. Bit harsh on #Arsenal, who looked more fluid in possession- all too familiar. Can #Wenger come up with the answer this time? 
#Rooney plays #Anderson through but #Szczesny races out to save superbly. #Schmeichel like. #Arsenal taking more risks now.
 #Arsenal pouring forward, #United sitting deep to pick them off on the break. #Nani wastes a great chance after sustained #Arsenal pressure. 
5th penalty in last 8 visits here #Arsenal have conceded...
FT 1-0.#United were hanging on a bit at the end. #Arsenal a touch unlucky to lose. Haven't we been here before?
#Arsenal get #Barcelona. It had to be!
Bad news for #Arsenal that on many levels. #Fabregas talk will start again and he may see gulf between sides at close quarters again.
@jamesdalton1980 Tough one to call given Chelsea's bad form at present and Arsenal's inability to keep a clean sheet. I'd say score draw.
Funny story about #Wilshere- had new Audi 4x4 delivered to #Arsenal training ground but been sitting there all week as it is not road taxed!
#Bowyer given three game ban for tackle on #Sagna in #Arsenal.
 #Wenger: #Vela will leave #Arsenal on loan. #Bolton favourites but #Valencia also keen.   Club who give guarantee he will play can sign him.   
 #Arsenal team v #ManCity: #Fabianski, #Sagna, #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Song, #Wilshere; #Walcott, #Fabregas, #Nasri, #VanPersie. 
#Arsenal should be ahead. They play their penalty box passing game and #VanPersie just fails to connect with the goal gaping. Fast start.
 Break in play and #Mancini has chat with #DeJong, who is struggling to cope with #Arsenal's movement. Seems a matter of time for the Gunners 
#Arsenal 0-0 #ManCity HT. Don't know how though. City showing no ambition beyond repelling incessant #Arsenal attacks.
#VanPersie hits one from 25 yards that is arrowing into the top corner but #Hart makes a top class save to deny him. #Arsenal still on top.
#Arsenal 0-0 #ManCity. FT. #Mancini doesn't shake #Wenger's hand and instead walks onto the pitch to argue with the ref and #Fabregas.
Read Jack #Wilshere on #Arsenal's 0-0 draw with #ManCity first in Thursday's #LondonEveningStandard.
 VanPersie, #Nasri both set to be rested for #Arsenal against Leeds. Expect #Gibbs, #Szczesny, #Eboue and to start. Reckon #Bendtner too. 
 Not to be outdone by #Spurs, #Arsenal have announced #Thierry #Henry will train with the club this month. He was at #ManCity game too. 
@_TimMcSweeney Chelsea and Spurs both played yesterday and Arsenal were Saturday. That's the only reason. Lots of Carling Cup stuff to come!
Arrived at #Ipswich. Proper football club. Lovely press room soup. Constant rain plus slick surface should bode well for #Arsenal passing.
 #Arsenal: #Szczesny, #Eboue, #Koscielny, #Djourou, #Gibbs; #Wilshere, #Denilson, #Walcott, #Fabregas, #Arshavin; #Bendtner. Strong side. 
#Arsenal need to be careful because they are getting sloppy. #Wickham is a real threat from the left and #Ipswich are battling hard.
 #Arsenal are, frankly, all over the place at the moment. #Priskin is in after a long ball over the top but #Djourou scrambles clear. 
#Ipswich 1-0 #Arsenal. They deserve it too. #Priskin is played in by #Healy and he slides it past #Szczesny. A little over 10 mins left.
#Ipswich 1-0 #Arsenal. Full time. Deserved. Should have been more in the end. #Arsenal wilted badly but they have the second leg to recover.
Read #Fabregas on #Arsenal's defeat to #Ipswich first in Thursday's #LondonEveningStandard.
@JamieStell Certainly a raw talent but thought his attitude was excellent and caused #Arsenal problems. Looks the real deal.
Wenger hinted this morning #Almunia and #Arshavin will not leave #Arsenal this month. Will follow up at lunchtime press conference.
Sell out for FA Cup 3rd Rnd Replay #Leeds v #Arsenal tomorrow- their first of the season. Should be great atmosphere- looking forward to it.
 #Arsenal team (4-2-3-1) v #Leeds: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Djourou, #Gibbs; #Denilson, #Song; #Bendtner, #Nasri, #Arshavin; #Chamakh. 
 #Leeds 0-2 #Arsenal. #O'Brien clears it to #Sagna, who fires home from 16 yards. Think that's only his 3rd goal for #Arsenal. 
 #Leeds 1-2 #Arsenal. My word- pick that out. #Howson lays it off to #Johnson, who hits a screamer from 30 yards into the top corner. 
#Leeds 1-3 #Arsenal. That should be that. #VanPersie heads home #Bendtner's cross. Spirited performance from Leeds but class has told.
 #Leeds 1-3 #Arsenal. That should be that. #Bendtner crosses fro #VanPersie, who steers a header, yes a header, past #Schmeichel. 
@mirkobolesan Its not gone through yet but #Arsenal looking to make it happen in the next few days.
 #Arsenal lead race for Alex #Chamberlain after his dad describes them as   the ideal choice  . Clubs haggling over fee- Saints want £10m. 
 #Arsenal (4-2-3-1): #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Djourou, #Clichy; #Wilshere, #Denilson; #Bendtner, #Fabregas, #Arshavin; #VanPersie. 
#Arsenal started well but #Ipswich holding their own. Just about. #Sagna has to come off injured to be replaced by #Eboue.
 #Ipswich fans singing '1-0 to the rugby team'. #Fabregas doing everything to drive #Arsenal forward, RVP has hit the bar but no joy yet. 
 #Arsenal 1-0 #Ipswich. #Wilshere's diagonal pass finds #Bendtner on the left, he cuts inside before bending a superb curling shot past Fulop 
#Arsenal 2-0 #Ipswich. #Koscielny is totally unmarked to head home #Fabregas' corner. #Arsenal going to Wembley as it stands...
#Arsenal 3-0 #Ipswich. #Fabregas nutmegs Fulop from close range. The Gunners are off to Wembley and #Ipswich's spirit is surely broken.
3-0 FT. So #Arsenal will go to Wembley in the last weekend of February. #Fabregas inspirational but credit to #Ipswich who fought valiantly.
Read #Wilshere's thoughts on #Arsenal reaching the Carling Cup Final in #Wednesday's #LondonEveningStandard.
What the FA Cup is all about - #MUFC v #Crawley. #Arsenal go to Leyton #Orient - good moneyspinner for Barry Hearn that too.
So #Arsenal sign Japanese striker Ryo #Miyaichi... And Gooners fans thought there would be no big signing...
 #Arsenal lineup v #Everton: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Djourou, #Clichy; #Song, #Wilshere; #Walcott, #Fabregas, #Rosicky; #VanPersie. 
 #Arsenal 0-1 #Everton. Controversial. #Coleman chips a pass for #Saha, who is offside, #Koscielny diverts it into his path and he fires home 
 #Diaby, #Arshavin and now #Bendtner all on in 2nd half as #Arsenal look to rescue 0-1 scoreline. Had all of the ball but few clear chances. 
#Arsenal 1-1 #Everton. Right on cue. #Fabregas lifts it over the Everton defence for #Arshavin to cooly slot past #Howard. Game on.
 #Arsenal 2-1 #Everton. #Koscielny, totally unmarked, heads home #VanPersie's corner. Two goals in six minutes - complete turnaround. 
FT 2-1 #Arsenal. A triumph over adversity as #Arsenal make this about their fighting spirit and not a difficult night for referee Lee Mason.
Read #Koscielny's view on #Arsenal's chances in the title race first in Wednesday's #LondonEveningStandard.
 @_TimMcSweeney Arsenal played Saturday, Chelsea played Sunday- we go bigger on Sunday games because of their immediacy and better access! 
 Some debate over the system but #England 4-2-3-1 for my money - #Lampard and #Wilshere sitting deep, the latter in same role as for Arsenal. 
 @GurjitSoor Agreed- #Arsenal have been tracking him, as have #Liverpool. Signed a new long-term deal at #Ajax last year though. 
#Nasri starts for #Arsenal.
 #Arsenal: #Szczesny, #Eboue, #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Song, #Wilshere; #Walcott, #Fabregas, #Nasri; #VanPersie. #Arshavin on bench. 
Stunning move from #Arsenal - #Walcott jinks inside and plays it to #Fabregas who flicks it to RVP and his shot is saved well.
#Arsenal 0-1 #Barcelona. They had their warnings. #Messi slides in #Villa and he makes no mistake. It was tight but definitely onside.
 HT 0-1. Which is probably fair. #Barca passing majestic at times, but #Arsenal still in it. #Song on a tightrope after his yellow. 
#Arsenal 1-1 #Barcelona. It comes out of nothing. Clichy plays in #VanPersie who beats #Valdez at his near post. Shocking keeping.
 #Arsenal 2-1 #Barcelona. Oh my. #Nasri burts clear and squares it to #Arshavin, who curls a delightful shot in the corner past #Valdes. 
FT 2-1 #Arsenal. Remarkable turnaround and credit the #Gunners for digging that out from nowehere.
 #Arsenal team v #Stoke: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Djourou, #Squillaci, #Clichy; #Wilshere, #Song; #Walcott, #Fabregas, #Nasri; #Bendtner. 
 #Arsenal should be ahead. #Wilshere goes on a jinking run, #Fabregas plays a delicious ball to #Walcott, who hits the inside of the post. 
#Arsenal 1-0 #Stoke. Visitors have been on the rack and #Squllaci heads home #Bendtner's cross to give scoreline a slant that reflects play.
#Arsenal well on top.... but out of nowhere #Carew crashes a shot from distance that forces a decent save from #Szczesny. Never done at 1-0.
 FT 1-0 #Arsenal. Nervy at times in the second half but job done. Question is, for how big a price? #Fabregas/#Walcott inj updates to follow. 
 #Arsenal: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Song, #Wilshere; #Rosicky, #Nasri, #Arshavin; #VanPersie. 
 Nervy start from #Arsenal but they have settled a little now - #Rosicky given #Fabregas' playmaker role, #Nasri on right. Surprising. 
#Arsenal 0-1 #Birmingham. #Johnson flicks a corner goalwards and #Zigic is there to glance it past #Szczesny. Game well and truly on.
 Got to say, #Arsenal are on the rack a bit here. They simply cannot handle #Zigic and #Birmingham are winning the 50-50's. 
 #Arsenal 1-1 #Birmingham. Against the run of play, brilliant equaliser. #Arshavin cross and #VanPersie hits a stunning volley. 
 HT 1-1. Decent game with a fiery edge that is bubbling beneath the surface. #Arsenal fortunate to still have 11 men, #Birmingham resilient. 
 Its #Foster v #Arsenal right now - saves from Nasri, Rosicky, Bendtner, Nasri again... momentum all with the #Gunners... 
#Arsenal 1-2 #Birmingham. Its a calamity. #Koscielny and #Szczesny make a hash of a routine clearance and #Martins taps into an empty net.
 FT 1-2 #Birmingham. Credit the Blues but #Arsenal threw that away. #Szczesny has gone to each #Arsenal player, presumably to apologise. 
 #Arsenal players absolutely devastated, none more so than #Wilshere. Big test of their character now. #Foster deserved man of the match. 
 #McLeish:   For a small club like #Birmingham to beat the might of Arsenal is a dream come true.   
 #Arsenal post loss of 2.5m for 6 mths ending 30 Nov. Explained by lack of player sales, fewer property sales and 4.5m increase in wage bill. 
 #Arsenal: #Almunia; #Eboue, #Miquel, #Squillaci, #Gibbs; #Denilson, #Henderson; #Bendtner, #Rosicky, #Diaby; #Chamakh. 
 #Arsenal 1-0 #LeytonOrient. #Rosicky's bursts into the box and he squares it to #Chamakh, who sidefoots home. That'll settle them down. 
#Arsenal 2-0 #LOrient. #Bendtner from #Gibbs' cross. Maybe that will settle down a very agitated crowd.
 #Arsenal 3-0 #LOrient. Suicidal fromOrient, #Bendtner makes it three with a low drive that bobbles into the corner. 
#Arsenal 4-0 #LOrient. #Bendtner hat-trick - penalty after Gibbs was brought down by Revell. 2nd hat trick for the club - 1st v Porto.
#Arsenal 5-0 LOrient. #Clichy lashes one home from inside the box. Harsh on Orient who have played with spirit but no quality in final third
 #Arsenal (4-2-3-1): #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Wilshere, #Denilson; #Arshavin, #Nasri, #Diaby; #Bendtner. 
No fluency from #Arsenal. #Wilshere can't get in game. Curious #Nasri not given that role - he was superb there when Fab was injured before.
 HT 0-0. #Nasri looking most likely, #Wilshere couple of nice passes but #Arsenal subdued and crowd agitated. More needed in 2nd half. 
#Arsenal turning up the heat now - #Wilshere's cross finds #Chamakh whose powerful header cannons back off the bar.
FT 0-0. #Arsenal gave it the kitchen sink at the end but that's a big opportunity missed. Its only #Barcelona next too...
(Think he meant #Wilshere is young to play in first team). #Guardiola: I hear about fragility of the Arsenal players' minds but don’t agree.
 #Fabregas:   I don’t like people talking about what I feel – only I know how I feel. I want to do well for Arsenal and that is it.   
#VanPersie set to be on the bench for #Arsenal against #Barcelona tonight. Passed a fitness test but #Wenger reluctant to risk him.
 #Arsenal 4-2-3-1: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Diaby, #Wilshere; #Nasri, #Fabregas, #Rosicky; #Van Persie. 
Very attacking line up from #Arsenal. They won't go down without a fight. Concerned about how much #Wilshere & #Diaby can protect back 4 tho
Stadium announcer read out #Arsenal team - all surnames except 'Cesc'.
#Arsenal got away with one there. #Diaby on #Messi very close to box. Not given. #Barca dominating but they've only had 2 shots.
 #Barcelona 1-0 #Arsenal. Had to be #Messi. He'd just missed a glorious chance earlier. Iniesta's pass, scoops ball over Almunia and finishes 
#Barcelona 1-1 #Arsenal. #Busquets heads #Nasri's corner into his own net. Game on!
 #Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal. #Iniesta. Had been coming. Wonderful move, cool finish. 20 mins left before extra time as it stands. 
#Barcelona 3-1 #Arsenal. #Messi converts easily after #Koscielny fouls #Pedro.
Oh #Arsenal could have stolen it. Wilshere feeds Bendtner but poor touch and it gets away from him. #Wenger on his knees in tech area.
FT 3-1. #Arsenal are out. #Wenger waits for referee and disappears down the tunnel deep in conversation. VanPersie red was harsh.
#United set up to win 1-0. Different system but #Arsenal must be sick of this at OT- same as Dec. #Wenger must find a response though.
 Forget psychological blows, #Djourou out for any lengthy period of time is a big loss for #Arsenal. Being stretchered off at Old Trafford. 
Just the league then for #Arsenal. No disgrace losing at OT but #Wenger has big task rallying side's self-belief now.
#Arsenal in talks to resign #Lehmann on emergency loan.
 @GurjitSoor On a short-term deal, and as a free agent, Arsenal could do worse. Not sure how #Almunia will react though. They never got on. 
 German papers say #Lehmann has agreed a deal with #Arsenal to sign until the end of season.   I will support Almunia,   he said. We'll see. 
 #Arsenal sceptical over #Djourou's shoulder inj, Swiss FA saying he could play again this season. Think they want him fit for #eng on 4 June 
#Usmanov has nudged his stake in #Arsenal over 27 per cent. Market is fairly quiet although interesting he remains active.
 #Wilshere off, #Downing on. Another good shift from the #Arsenal boy wonder. 4-3-3 suited him- #Parker enabled him to get forward more. 
 #Real 2-0 #thfc. Short corner worked to #Marcelo, who delivers a great cross and #Adebayor heads home. Might like him a bit more at #afc now 
 #Arsenal team v Blackpool: #Almunia; #Eboue, #Squillaci, #Koscielny; #Clichy; #Wilshere, #Diaby; #Nasri, #Fabregas, #Arshavin; #VanPersie. 
@IainRodger1 True in the short term but Arsenal fans would console themselves with the idea they're club are much better placed long-term.
#Lehmann starts in goal for #Arsenal- injury to #Almunia in warm-up.
 More on #Almunia: it is a knee injury sustained in the warm-up. #Arsenal staff say it is   not too serious   but enough to rule him out today. 
@IainRodger1 True but most Arsenal fans I speak to these days need something to cling to!
 #Blackpool 0-1 #Arsenal. Flowing move from Arsenal - #Fabregas finds Van Persie, who squares it for #Diaby to sidefoot home. 
 #Blackpool 0-1 #Arsenal. Flowing move from Arsenal - #Fabregas finds Van Persie, who squares it for #Diaby to sidefoot home. 
#Blackpool 0-2 #Arsenal. #Eboue smashes home from #Wilshere's cute pass.
 HT 0-2. #Arsenal. Gunners in total control but at 2-0 game not quite dead. #Lehmann competent, #Fabregas dictating play, RVP dangerous. 
#Blackpool 1-2 #Arsenal. Lehmann fortunate not to be sent off as he hauls down #Campbell. #Taylor-Fletcher turns home rebound.
#Arsenal on the rack here. Blackpool should have had a penalty and #Puncheon has missed a glorious chance from close range.
 #Blackpool 1-3 #Arsenal. #Walcott breaks free down the right and squares it to #VanpErsie, who sidefoots home. Game over, surely. 
 FT #Blackpool 1-3 #Arsenal. Good going forward, shaky at the back. Story of their season? Title hopes not extinquished yet though. 
 #Kroenke in statement:   We will continue to support and adhere to the self-sustaining business model hitherto pursued by Arsenal.   
 In other words, don't expect Abramovich-style investment from #Kroenke at #Arsenal. #Wenger will have money but within the club's means. 
 #Usmanov set to retain 27pc, use as holding stake in #Arsenal to block any major restructuring not in his interests. Read more in #Standard. 
 As #standardsport reported yesterday, #Usmanov confirms: 'I'm not going to sell my stake. I love Arsenal, that's why I'm a shareholder.' 
 #Arsenal team: Szczesny, Eboue, Koscielny, Djourou, Clichy, Diaby, Wilshere, Walcott, Fabregas, Nasri, Van Persie 
 #Arsenal on front foot at home - #Koscielny hit bar. #Robinson on for #Aurelio, who comes off injured for #lfc. 22 mins gone. 0-0. 
HT 0-0. More needed from #Arsenal - they have now gone 240 minutes without scoring a goal at the Emirates. (Last goal #Clichy v L Orient).
#Carroll off and #Shelvey on. Really youthful look to #lfc now. #Bendtner and #Arshavin imminent for #Arsenal.
#Song on for #Diaby. He may prove me wrong but can't see him getting a winner. #afc have 8 minutes to find a winner. Not looking likely.
 Plus stoppage time of course, which will be lengthy following Carragher injury. Agitated home crowd, #afc seemingly lack belief. 
Penalty to Arsenal
#Arsenal 1-0 #Liverpool. #VanPersie scores.
#Arsenal 1-1 #Liverpool. #Wenger and #Dalglish exchange heated words as #Kuyt scored with last kick of the game.
 #Fabregas: #Arsenal must choose-   go out to win or develop players.   Also:   if I leave Arsenal it will be with my head, not just because.   
 #afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Song, #Diaby; #Walcott, #Fabregas, #Nasri; #VanPersie. 
 #Tottenham 0-1 #Arsenal. #Huddlestone loses possession and #Fabregas feeds #Walcott, who breaks clear and slots past #Gomes. 
 #Tottenham 1-1 #Arsenal. Instant response. #Corluka finds #VanderVaart, who controls brilliantly and smashed it past #Szczesny. 
 #Tottenham 1-3 #Arsenal. After #Nasri made it 2-1, #VanPersie doubles their advantage forcing the ball home at the 2nd attempt. 
#Tottenham 2-3 #Arsenal. #Huddlestone smashes a losse ball left footed from 25 yards past a helpless #Szczesny. Great hit.
HT 2-3. Arsenal on top and better in possession but look vulnerable at the back. Spurs battling. Fantastic game. More please.
 #Wilshere imminent for #Arsenal. Replacing Diaby, looks injured. 
Still 2-3 but Arsenal look a touch nervy. Feels as though there is another goal in it...
#Tottenham 3-3 #Arsenal. #VanderVaart scores after #Szczesny brings down #Lennon. 20 mins for either side to find a winner.
FT 3-3. Fair result but two points dropped for #Arsenal having been 3-1 up. Arsenal players look dejected. Gallas hobbles off.
#Scholes and #Anderson on for #Park and #Hernandez. United can now have one eye on Sunday and #Arsenal.
@LyallThomas True- Arsenal v Man Utd games of a few years ago notorious for it. Keane and Vieira chief culprits but they all got involved.
 #Wenger:   We will never give up on the title as long as there is a mathematical chance. If we did, we'd have no right to be at #Arsenal.   
#Arsenal confirm ticket prices to rise by 6.5 per cent including VAT for start of next season. Thoughts #afc fans?
 Carnage on London trains trying to north. #afc at Stoke and #cfc at #mufc making Euston fun and games. Trains full, some fans giving up.

@dgjones I managed to get a seat but refused entry to 12.15 train because of overcrowding. Several Arsenal fans around me just gave up!
@timpayton #afc ALWAYS lie about attendances!
@grahamsm1th Ha ha. We'll see. Nowhere near as negative about Arsenal as you make out though! Theo could be the key next season.
 Off to Fulham shortly. Predictions: #afc to finish fourth, #Spurs fifth, #Birmingham and #Blackpool to go down. Thoughts? 
@StandardTim Spurs draw? Pessimistic to the last. Wouldn't argue Chelsea prediction. Think #Arsenal won't beat #Fulham.
 @StandardTim Defoe to answer Harry's criticism, Arsenal ended their season 2 weeks ago! 
 #afc: Szczesny, Diaby, Sagna, Vermaelen, Nasri, Van Persie, Ramsey, Wilshere, Djourou, Gibbs, Chamakh. 
 #afc lined up 4-4-2. Wenger experimenting away from 4-2-3-1 system. Ramsey rt, Nasri lft, RVP & Chamakh up front. Who said he was stubborn? 
#Fulham 1-0 #Arsenal. Djourou plays Zamora onside and he cuts it back for Sidwell to sidefoot home.
#ffc 1-1 #afc. Lovely move as Diaby plays in Van Persie who scores for the ninth successive away game.
 #Vermaelen's superb goalline clearance to deny Murphy making it 2-1 to #ffc. #afc fans sing:   We've miss you all year.   How right. 
 HT #ffc 1-1 #afc. Even contest, #Djourou very shaky at the back, #RVP bright as ever. Can't call it either way but cant see it staying 1-1. 
#Fulham 2-1 #Arsenal. #Zamora climbs to head home Greening's cross from inside 6 yard box.
 #afc triple change (dont see it often) Walcott, Eboue & Arshavin on for Diaby, Ramsey & Gibbs. #ffc Murphy & Greening off for Etuhu & Davies 
 #afc away fans chanting at #Wenger:   Spend your f***ing money.   
#Fulham 2-2 #Arsenal. Piercing run from #Walcott and he finishes low past #Schwarzer into the corner.
#Arsenal announce pre-season game in Malaysia on July 13 against 'Malaysia XI'. Second game expected to be in China but unconfirmed yet.
Not sure how kindly #Wenger will take to #Nasri brinkmanship. Apparently wants at least £110k-a-week to stay at #afc.
#Barnet fc say #Arsenal won't play annual July friendly at Underhill. All #afc reserve games were staged there in return but rules changed.
 If #Jones deal goes through, #mufc will have future centre-back pairing who both snubbed #Arsenal. #Smalling turned #Wenger down too. 
@nickstone22 Quite right about Ramsey and Wenger definitely saved money but think a lot of #afc want him to pay over the odds if needed!
@timpayton #afc figure going up significantly this year though- a lot of renegotiated contracts.
 #Arsenal losing battle to keep #Clichy. Suggestion is #Wenger would rather sell abroad than to #lfc. B Munich, Inter, Roma, Juve all keen. 
Looks like #Arsenal missing out on #Cahill now too. #mcfc favourites to get him and make first summer signing. May well move for #Samba.
 Wow. #eng level at 1-1. #Welbeck. #Spain U21's dominated the game, gorgeous passing, didn't kill it off. Maybe they are the new #Arsenal. 
 #afc interest in Lille striker #Gervinho is concrete. Lille official Frederic Paquet:   He wants to go and has had contact with #Arsenal.   
 #Arsenal receive bid from Sporting Lisbon for #Bendtner. Thought to be around £7m. #Dortmund, #Hamburg, #Besiktas also keen. 
#Arsenal all but signed #Gervinho. Fee is £10.5m and a 4-yr deal. Expected to be announced before end of week. Should hasten Bendtner exit.
@Darren_Oakley You dont seem to be alone in that sentiment. Always thought he's half decent but not an Arsenal player.
@mainakhazra05 It seemed earlier in the week #mcfc had stolen a march on #Arsenal but #Wenger still keen on him. 1st choice before Samba.
#Barca offer was nearer to £30m for #Cesc. Paper reports #Arsenal want £60m is a tactic- meet in the middle at £45m. That's the asking price
@RajCrew £45m for a player who started only 29 games and who wants to leave isn't bad money. #Arsenal much weaker without him though.
 #Arsenal set to confirm #Gervinho and #Cahill deals this week. £12m for former, #Cahill yet to be finalised. Has £17m release clause though. 
 @arsenalreport Ha! Gervinho virtually done, Cahill less so - that one is more complicated but Arsenal confident. 
Back from long holiday. Nothing changed for my money - still feel #Fabregas will leave #Arsenal and #Nasri will stay as said a month ago.
 #Arsenal trying to sign Real Madrid teenage striker Jose Rodriquez. Named Best Player at U17WC. Visited Colney, compensation being discussed 
Real offered Rodriquez a professional contract as a counter move. Player mulling it over but Wenger claims he'll be in #afc side quicker
#Arsenal team photo at the club's Members' Day has been postponed due to bad weather at Emirates Stadium. Bullet dodged.
 #Fabregas and #Nasri training at Emirates. #afc say team photo to be at Colney in 2 wks   Rain delayed it, any other speculation is nonsense   
#Arsenal drawn against Udinese in CL play-off round. Finished fourth in Serie A last season. Exact dates to follow. #afc
#Fabregas not on trip to Portugal is a late decision. Ominous for #afc chances of keeping him. Saga needs to end soon for everyone's benefit
@MeiriAdi Hard to disagree. Letting it drag on this long is bad for everyone. Barca behaviour poor but #afc must realise when they're beaten
 As has been reported elsewhere, Oxlade-Chamberlain is indeed undergoing a medical at #Arsenal. 
 #Bendtner confirms on Sky Sports News he will be leaving #Arsenal.   I want to play somewhere where I am happy and play every week.   #afc 
#Arshavin says he won't be leaving #Arsenal  this summer
 #Arshavin, linked with Russian club Anzhi, said:   They are things invented on the internet. I will play in Arsenal colours.   
 #Fabregas deal close because he has indicated he will waive £4m compensation payment #afc would give him for   not breaking his contract.   
#Nasri off too by the looks of it. £22m to Man City. Sky reporting #afc have made contact over Birmingham's Scott Dann. Cheaper than Cahill.
Some good news for #Arsenal fans: word from Colney is #VanPersie and #Vermaelen will be fit to face #nufc. Wilshere and Gibbs struggling tho
Strange press conference with #Wenger at #afc. He did say nobody would leave this month but overriding feeling is Fabregas and Nasri will go
on if they will leave as it would weaken #afc's negotiating position. Still expect the pair to leave tho. Just trying to get the best price.
#afc now have a little over 2 weeks to replace #Fabregas in the market. #Wenger didn't appear to be close to anything when speaking last wk.
#Wenger said earlier today #Arsenal wouldn't contest any #Song ban. Don't really see how they can either...
Right call to make @Persie_Official captain at #afc & #Vermaelen vice. Let's hope injuries are behind both now as they must lead by example.
 #afc team v Udinese: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen, #Gibbs; #Song, #Ramsey; #Gervinho, #Rosicky, #Walcott, #Chamakh. 
Perfect start for #afc as #Walcott gives home side the lead but Udinese no pushovers. Just hit the bar.
 Oh my, Arsenal living dangerously here. Defence looks leaky. Szczesny saves well after #Armero bursts through on goal. 
HT 1-0 #afc. #Walcott stand out performer but alarm bells at the back. Di Natale very lively - hit bar + post. More goals in this surely.
FT 1-0 #afc. I don't know how Udinese haven't scored. No away goal conceded could be vital but it'll be a tough night in Italy next Weds.
Decision on #Song's ban expected from FA this morning. Expected to be banned for 3 matches. #afc
 @LyallThomas For the record, he didn't get my vote! Although Parker would suit #afc. Wants a big contract tho as it'd be his last big move. 
#Nasri deal expected to be completed by the weekend after #Arsenal accept £22m bid. Few details to be sorted but should sign for #mcfc soon.
 Little #Nasri update. He's in Manchester today, #afc haggling over exact structure of the payments but should all be completed soon. 
 #Arsenal plan to appeal UEFA charge against #Wenger, according to club source. 
 #Djourou and #Traore ruled out. #Rosicky out too- he will be   rested   for tomorrow. #afc 
Impressed by #lfc organisation but these are dire times at #afc. Could get so much worse if #Udinese are not seen off on Weds. Huge game.
 #Arsenal to appeal #Wenger ban. Club claim UEFA are   unclear   as to whether an appeal means Wenger won't be banned for Udinese match on Wed. 
#Nasri still should join #mcfc. #afc agreed £22m deal but at last minute agents demand £3m payment taking total to £25m. Compromise expected
@Longy1806 @Gooner_66 #afc made enquiry about M'Vila from Rennes. Would cost around £12m but not may be reluctant to sell.
 @NorthBankJay Exactly. Its a case of how quickly the appeal hearing can be arranged. #afc don't know, #UEFA don't have automatic procedure. 
#Nasri training at Colney this morning with #Arsenal.
I've just landed in Italy ahead of #afc's game tomorrow with to hear club confirm #Nasri's move to #mcfc should be finalised tonight.
 For any #afc fans coming out to Italy and saddened by #Nasri departure, I can say it is baking hot here. Bring your shades and sun lotion. 
@sarahsportmag Fair enough- am struggling for plus points regarding #afc right now! Looks like Wilshere could be out for longer than thought
@frank361afc Must have been a great night. Udinese good going forward but fancy #afc to score. It'll be close though.
#Wenger to be on touchline for second leg as UEFA organise appeal hearing for after tomorrow night's game v #Udinese. #afc
#Wenger says he will look to sign 1 or 2 players to strengthen his squad regardless of if #afc exit Champions League.
 #Nasri completes move to Man City. Four year deal worth around £165,000-a-week. He'll wear No19. Fee thought to be £24m. #afc 
Talk #afc could be in CL regardless of result tonight cos they're 5th in UEFA co-efficient table. Statement at 7.30pm wont be definitive.
 #afc team to face #Udinese: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Djourou, #Vermaelen, #Jenkinson; #Song, #Ramsey, #Frimpong; #Walcott, #Van Persie, #Gervinho 
#Arsenal warming up in Stadio Friuli. ://yfrog.com/kedwfhkj 
 #Jenkinson looks vulnerable to the pace of Armero, Di Natale typically a threat. #afc set up to score away goal but concerns at the back. 
 UEFA confirm Trabzonspor will take #Fenerbahce's place in CL. Arsenal, you are on your own. 
#Udinese 1-0 #afc. Di Natale header.
 HT #Udinese 1-0 #afc. Deserved goal for best player on pitch, Di Natale. Away goal would change everything but character defining 45 ahead. 
#Rosicky on for #Frimpong for #Arsenal at half time.
#Udinese 1-1 #afc. Huge goal. Great work from Gervinho to find #VanPersie to sidefoot home.
#Udinese 1-2 #afc. Walcott races clear and kills the tie.
#FT 1-2 #afc. Vital win secured with character and grit. Rode their luck but a job well done under the circumstances.
 Seen #Nasri's interview with #mcfc TV. Amazing how he endlessly refused interviews at #afc in part cos of his English, but now its improved. 
 #Arsenal will go back in for #Cahill. Been No1 centre-back target all along, #Wenger keen + recommended by chief scout Steve Rowley. 
 @Goofle11 @northbanklower #afc were in for Jones, absolutely, but Cahill been a long standing interest. Right about Jagielka, same for Samba 
 #Wenger says #afc bid higher than £6m for #Cahill.   You can believe me or you can believe Gartside. It is up to you.   
 #afc:  Szczesny; Jenkinson, Djourou Koscielny, Traore; Coquelin, Ramsey, Rosicky; Walcott, VanPersie, Arshavin. 
Same #mufc team as against Spurs. Rio on bench. Concern for #afc is vulnerability in wide areas- Jenkinson and Traore against Nani and Young
#mufc on top and look the more likely but #afc holding their own. Odd atmopshere inside OT - usually rocking for this fixture.
#mufc 1-0 #afc. Livelier now. Anderson scoops the ball over #afc backline and #Welbeck heads home.
Penalty to Arsenal
 #mufc 2-0 #afc, Young curls a superb effort into the top corner. 
 #mufc -0 #afc. Superb free-kick from Rooney. Top corner, Szczesny did well to get a hand to it. Result sorted, question of how many now. 
#mufc 3-1 #afc. #Walcott beats DeGea too easily - went with feet instead of hands - from acute angle.
 HT 3-1 #mufc. Welbeck goal soft, Young & Rooney goals superb. Top De Gea save from RVP pen, poor keeping for Walcott goal. 3-1 flatters #afc 
#afc fans havent stopped singing in this second half and it is lifting the team - #mufc started half well but #afc getting a foothold now.
 #Oxlade-Chamberlain on for his debut, Coquelin off. #afc fans still singing...   we love you Arsenal   over and over... 
#mufc 4-1 #afc. #Rooney free-kick again. Beats Szczesny in the flight.
 #mufc 5-1 #afc. Rooney plays in #Nani, #afc all over the place and he dinks it over Szczesny. 
 #mufc 6-1 #afc. Park in on the act, scoring from Young's pass. 
 #mufc 6-2 #afc. #VanPersie volleys home. Emphatic finish. Insane game, this. 
#mufc 7-2 #afc. Rooney scores to complete his hat-trick.
#mufc 8-2 #afc. #Young curls another fine shot past Szczesny.
#Arsenal in talks to sign Mertesacker from Werder Bremen. Club debt means he's available for £8m. Bolton's Cahill stance proving restrictive
Still expect #afc to sign midfielder. M'Vila tops the list above Sochaux's Marvin Martin and Lille's Eden Hazard. #Arteta enquiry dismissed.
Cant help feeling that #Bendtner hasnt left #afc yet because of the gap between the clubs he thinks he can play for and those that want him.
 Waiting for flight to Bulgaria. Key #eng games lost amid deadline madness. Arteta proven PL class, not sure how good Benayoun still is #afc 
 #ff @benrumsbyPA for Chelsea info, @jimvanwijkPA if you want to know about Arsenal, love for Norwich and his kids. 
#Arsenal knew setback over #Wilshere injury was coming- partly explains decision to sign Benayoun on loan. Loan ins very rare for #Wenger.
 #Wenger to serve 2-game touchline ban after UEFA rejects #Arsenal appeal   for not abiding by earlier decision  . 
#afc right to be upset- seemingly given conflicting messages by UEFA. Whole issue needs clarification for future incidents.
Park been included in #afc squad although he's awaiting visa. Paperwork should be done tonight but doubt he'll start. Not met team-mates yet
 @j4cksm1th Understand why you feel that way but a lot of Arsenal fans think I'm too harsh on them, non-Arsenal fans too kind. Can't win! 
 So much for German efficiency. Lufthansa flight to Dusseldorf delayed by 90 mins, now train to Dortmund late. #afc presser at 5.15 UK time. 
 Dortmund coach #Klopp giving relaxed and jovial press conference.   I was at #mufc v #afc and it could have been 15-10.   
 #Klopp on #afc through an interpreter (whose deadpan delivery makes it):   They are not very good with the ball. This is a joke.   
 First impression of the Signal Iduna Park stadium: mightily impressive. Dortmund officials say 65,590 expected tomorrow, inc 1,500 #afc fans 
 #afc team v Dortmund: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Mertesacker, #Koscielny, #Gibbs; #Arteta, #Song, #Benayoun, #VanPersie, #Walcott, #Gervinho. 
 #Benayoun playing in holding role alongside Song, Arteta further forward. 4-2-3-1 #afc 
 Mmm, maybe 4-3-3 when they attack- Barca-esque (in shape at least). Song deep with Arteta and Benayoun pushing on. #afc 
 Whatever the system, #afc living dangerously here. Dortmund missed three good chances already. Defence looks nervy. 
#Dortmund 0-1 #afc. Terrible mistake at the back and Van Persie is put clear to score.
HT 0-1 #afc. Clinical from #VanPersie to give Arsenal the lead against the run of play.
A 'what we have we hold substitution' as Frimpong comes on for Walcott. Under 15 left #afc 1-0 up.
#Dortmund 1-1 #afc. What a strike. Free-kick cleared only to #Perisic who strikes a stunning volley into the top corner.
FT 1-1. #afc denied a morale-boosting win by a stunning late strike. Dortmund worthy of a point on balance of play but cruel late blow.
 On the train to Manchester for #mufc v #cfc. Should be a belter. Still trying to digest #afc result at #brfc. In a way, worse than the 8-2. 
 HT 3-0 #mufc. Scoreline is harsh on #cfc who were decent for a long spell but wasted chances. #mufc fans:   Are you Arsenal in disguise?   
 Ju Young Park set to make his #afc debut in Carling Cup tomorrow night. #Oxlade-Chamberlain, Miyaichi also involved in youthful line-up. 
 #Gazidis:   When we look at #afc in last 5 years, some people say its a total failure. I can't accept that- we've been incredibly consistent   
 #Gazidis:   Arsene is not broken. He is portrayed as some kind of idiot and that is damaging, not for Arsenal or Arsene, but for the game.   
 Swings and roundabouts. Anyway, at Emirates for #afc Carling Cup tie. Shrewsbury fans here early to enjoy their day out. And why not? 
 #afc team: #Fabianski, #Jenkinson, #Djourou, #Miquel, #Gibbs; #Coquelin, #Frimpong; #Oxlade-Chamberlain, #Park, #Benayoun; #Chamakh. 
#afc 0-1 #Shrewsbury. Oh my. Awful marking and Collins heads home from close range.
Youthful #afc team but Benayoun doesnt close down the cross and Djourou is all at sea at centre-back.
@JamesG_City_AM Truly woeful defending. Plenty of time (and surely #afc have a goal in them) but worrying signs.
 #afc 1-1  #Shrewsbury. Gibbs heads home, it has to be said, against the run of play after Jenkinson's cross isn't cleared. 
HT 1-1 Shrewsbury good value for parity. #afc OK going forward (nothing more) but alarming at the back. What's new?
#afc 2-1 #Shrewsbury. Decent strike from #Oxlade-Chamberlain but gk Smith should do better. It had been coming. #afc better in 2nd half.
 #afc 3-1 #Shrewsbury. #Benayoun seals victory from substitute Oguzhan Ozyakup's (he's a debutant and Dutch, believe it or not) pass. 
 FT 3-1 #afc ultimately had too much but Shrewsbury deserve credit for first half display. Oxlade-Chamberlain, Benayoun and Coquelin good. 
#VanPersie on bench for #afc tonight
 #afc team: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Mertesacker, #Song, #Santos; #Arteta, #Frimpong, #Rosicky, #Oxlade-Chamberlain, #Arshavin, #Chamakh. 
#afc 1-0 #Olympiacos. Terrible defending but Oxlade-Chamberlain finishes smartly - very composed and deadly that.
Superb block on the line from Arteta to deny Djebbour an equaliser. Just the kind of commitment to the cause #afc fans want to see.
#afc 2-0 #Olympiacos. #Santos scores his initial cross is blocked and he beats the keeper at his near post.
 #afc 2-1 #Olympiacos. Arsenal simply asleep from a corner and they work it to Fuster, who is unmarked, to head home. Awful. 
FT 2-1 #afc. Nervy at the back (Spurs watched with interest?) but did enough for important 3 pts. Oxlade-Chamberlain's stock grows.
 Stats: Shots: #afc 10-15 Olympiacos, on target afc 5-7 Olymp, possession afc 54-46 Olymp. Job done and players rested but not convincing. 
#Wenger urges fans to lay off Adebayor and focus on supporting #afc. Right sentiment but not sure if they'll listen...
#Green out for around six weeks with a knee injury so #Almunia brought in on emergency loan. #whufc #afc
 #Arsenal announce pre-tax profits of £12.8m but big rise in wage bill to £124m, 4th highest in PL. 
Wage bill rise is for improved deals across the squad. No massive earners in comparison to top 3 but maybe it needs restructuring. #afc
#Apologies - #afc is £14.8m pre-tax profit.
Just finished interview with @JackWilshere. Top lad fulfilling media commitments despite newborn baby and bad ankle. An example to many.#afc
 #VanderVaart in #thfc prog:   I think our squad is probably better than #afc's but we have to respect them as they can play great football.   
 #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Song, Gibbs, Walcott, Arteta, Ramsey, Coquelin, Gervinho, Van Persie. (Again, not in that order). 
 #thfc look 4-4-2 with Van der Vaart and Bale on the wings, #afc, Song at CB with Coquelin (his first start since 8-2 v mufc) in holding role 
 #afc fans chanting   It should have been you, shot in Angola, it should have been you   at #Adebayor. Deplorable. 
 #thfc 1-0 #afc. Adebayor's crossfield pass finds VanderVaart, who fires past Szczesny. 
Back to the game... can't see this ending 1-0. Both sides a threat going forward. #afc #thfc
Quite. #thfc 1-1 #afc. Ramsey converts from close range. Game on.
#afc dominating in midfield now. #Redknapp bringing on #Sandro to stem the tide. #thfc.
#thfc 2-1 #afc. Walker hits a screamer that swerves past Szczesny. Great hit.
FT 2-1 #thfc. #afc good for long spells but #thfc with better chances. Probably edged it on balance. Great entertainment.
 #afc & #thfc joint statement:   Neither club tolerates foul language, racist chanting, homophobic chanting or any anti-social behaviour.   
 #afc & #thfc statement:   We shall be working closely with each other to identify the individuals involved.   Well done to both clubs. 
 My exclusive interview with @JackWilshere in today's #LondonEveningStandard. Links: ://bit.ly/pyYMJ1  and ://bit.ly/pyYMJ1 
#afc 
 Djourou, Koscielny, Rosicky all fit for #afc against #Sunderland, says #Wenger. 
#afc 1-0 #sfc #VanPersie scores with less than a minute played. Clinical.
#afc 1-0 #safc #VanPersie scores with less than a minute played. Clinical.
 #VanPersie bang on it today. Scored the opener, hit the post with a delicious right-foot chip and just fired wide. #afc 
 #afc 1-1 #safc. Silly handball from Arteta gifts free-kick 25 yards out, #Larsson bends it into the top corner. Super finish. 
 HT #afc 1-1 #safc. The best and worse of Arsenal. Van Persie superb for 30 mins, awful defending lets safc into game. Great Larsson f/k tho. 
 Official attendance confirmed to press as 60,078. It really, really isn't. #afc 
#afc 2-1 #safc. RVP delivers. Superb free-kick (which he won himself) has surely broken the visitors' resistance.
FT #afc 2-1. Nervy finish. #VanPersie makes the difference (where would they be without him). Spirited #safc performance but fell short.
Always thought #Rosicky was a thoughtful and committed player but consensus on here is #afc fans aren't convinced by his answer.
 @deanowasthere89 Thanks for reading. Funnily enough, most Spurs fans like I am an Arsenal fan. its a fine balance. 
#Vermaelen has signed a new contract with #Arsenal until 2015. Good for the club they have sorted out their best defender early. RVP next?
 #Marseille captain #Mandanda:   We haven't talked about #afc a lot with the coach but we know that they can concede quite a lot of goals.   
 General tone of #Deschamps presser similar to plenty of #Wenger's recently. Why are players underperforming, fans disillusioned etc #afc 
 On that evidence, #afc fans can forget about #Cahill in January or any other centre-back for that matter... 
Bigger night for #afc back four though - Jenkinson/Mertersacker/Koscielny/Santos. Talented #OM forward line will provide stern test.
 Slovenian referee a little card happy here. Song and Santos already booked for #afc, #Ayew for #OM. Could be a red if it goes on like this. 
HT 0-0. Cagey stuff from two sides a little short on confidence. #afc 54pc possession but #OM fractionally more likely to score.
 Right, back at the game... #afc have 15 minutes to find a winner. Both sides look content with a point in all honesty. 
#afc 1-0 #Ramsey. Stolen it at the death.
 Thought #Koscielny was excellent tonight, #Ramsey's goal well taken - just spoken to him for tmw's paper. #afc in charge of Group F now. 
 Interesting player ratings in L'Equipe. No-one for #afc better than 6, two 7's for #OM. Keeper Mandanda and defender N'Koulou. Santos got 3. 
#Drobga will be suspended for game against #afc next weekend. Relief for Wenger - Torres back though...
 #afc: #Fabianski; #Yennaris, #Squillaci, #Miquel, #Vermaelen (c), #Coquelin, #Frimpong, #Chamberlain, #Benayoun, #Arshavin, #Park. 
Filing up now at Emirates as people continue to come in. £10 tickets working. #afc on top but #bwfc not without threat. 0-0 20 mins played.
 HT 0-0. #afc the better side but no breakthrough. #Park lively, #Arshavin encouraging, #Vermaelen looking good on return. 
 Official attendance 56,628. Very impressive indeed if true. Greeted with cries of   no way   from certain corners of the press box though.#afc 
#afc 0-1 #bwfc. Home side need to hear them now. #Muamba fires into the roof of the net after Frimpong loses possession.
 #afc 1-1 #bwfc. Immediate response. #Arshavin delivers, drilling the ball into the far corner. 
#afc 2-1 #bwfc Brilliant from Arshavin as he waits for Park to make the right run and Park then bends a superb shot into the far corner.
 #afc wobbling but still lead 2-1. Frimpong could have conceded pen, Fabianski narrowly avoided a howler before saving well from Klasnic. 
 FT 2-1 #afc. Hung on at the end but responded well to falling a goal behind. #Arshavin, #Park, #Vermaelen all good. 
At #afc AGM. Confirmed by Hill-Wood: Kroenke to speak shortly.
 #Kroenke:   #afc has a wonderful manager on the pitch who makes great decisions in regards to personnel and has a tremendous following.   
 Hill-Wood asked if season ticket prices will be reduced if #afc don't qualify for CL. He completely avoids the question. That's a no, then. 
Heading to early #afc presser at Colney. Was very impressed with #Wenger at AGM yesterday. Passionate speech put other speakers in the shade
 For those interested, here's my take on #afc AGM in yesterday's Standard. Here ://bit.ly/vUMZ9m  and here ://bit.ly/vNxbGR  
 Interesting stuff from Wenger. Says Chelsea's stadium problem may not be too bad as UEFA   too scared   to impose Financial Fair Play. #afc 
 At #afc training ahead of Marseille game. Looks like no Chamakh, Gibbs or Diaby. But Vermaelen and Jenkinson out there. 
 #Benayoun, #Jenkinson and #Vermaelen all fit. #Chamakh injured with a knee problem, says #Wenger. #afc 
 ...but appears fully supportive of Wenger and Gazidis. Also, won't take money out of the club but won't bankroll huge spree either. #afc 
 #afc v #OM: #Szczesny, #Jenkinson, #Mertesacker, #Vermaelen, #Santos; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Gervinho; #Park. #RVP on bench 
#afc 0-0 #OM Marseille improved from first meeting - playing with greater fluidity in final 3rd. Santos exposed at left-back. 25mins gone
 HT 0-0. Open game and #OM very much a threat, especially down the flanks. #afc been in and out - Park very quiet. How long until RVP? 
#Rosicky on for #Ramsey now. #OM edging this and #afc need energising. No doubt Wenger will say the #cfc game took a lot out of them.
#Arshavin on now for Gervinho. Last throw of the dice from Wenger as #afc look for a winner. 0-0. 13 mins left.
FT 0-0. Fair result on balance although #OM may feel they could have nicked it. #afc still in charge of Group F but need win v Dortmund now.
#Wenger confirms Van Persie will start against West Brom. #afc
 #afc team news via #Wenger:   Gibbs had hernia op and is out for 6 weeks. Jenkinson has a stress fracture in his back and out for 3-4 wks.   
 #Wenger:   I have two options- Koscielny and Djourou.   Also Henry will train at club until Feb- loan deal not likely at present. #afc 
 Re #Wenger leaving story & subsequent denial, no chance he will leave #afc before 2014. He won't go and board won't sack him. End of. 
 #afc team v Dortmund: #Szczesny; #Koscielny, #Mertesacker, #Vermaelen, #Santos; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Gervinho; #VanPersie. 
Dortmund look a threat early on. Remember Lewandowski's profligacy in the first meeting - better finishing and it could be tough for #afc.
 Gotze, who received treatment earlier on, is forced off injured. Big boost for #afc. Perisic, who scored an uber volley in 1st game, is on. 
 HT 0-0. Stalemate in truth. #Walcott looked lively for #afc in patches, Dortmund threatening but created little of note. 
 #afc 1-0. Great work from Song (yes, Song) to deliver a cross for that man #VanPersie to head home. 
 Koscielny coming off - looks to be an injury as he walks gingerly to the touchline. Djourou on. 7 mins left, as it stands #afc group winners 
Diaby now on for Walcott. First #afc appearance for the Frenchman since final day of last season at Fulham.
#afc 2-0. Van Persie again. Game over. Vermaelen flicks on a corner and Van Persie is unmarked to thrash it home.
#afc 2-1 #Kagawa strikes late on but surely no time for an equaliser.
FT 2-1 #afc. Last kick sees Dortmund score. But #afc group winners and so avoid big guns in last 16. And can rest players v Olympiacos.
 Possible #afc opponents as things stand: Napoli, Trabzonspor, Ajax, Zenit, AC Milan. Still one game to go though so can change considerably. 
 #afc team v #mcfc: #Fabianski; #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Miguel, #Yennaris; #Frimpong, #Benayoun, #Rosicky, #OxladeChamberlain, #Park, #Chamakh 
 CORRECTION: #afc: #Fabianski, #Djourou, #Squillaci, #Koscielny, #Miquel, #Frimpong, #Coquelin, #Benayoun, #Ox-Chamberlain, #Park, #Chamakh. 
 Kolorov, who doesn't look too happy about it, comes off and Aguero is on for #mcfc. Nasri boos relentless from #afc fans. 
 HT 0-0 #mcfc assured in possession but created little, #afc a threat on break. The OC showing no fear, Nasri jeered. Hope 2nd half is better 
 Stalemate at Emirates. #mcfc have possession but look disjointed. Away support singing   Van Persie is ours   to the annoyance of #afc fans 
#afc change: Vermaelen on for Miguel. #mcfc Razak replaces Hargreaves. Both sides toiling out there but extra time looms...
#afc 0-1 #mcfc. Maybe not. Superb breakaway goal as Dzeko finds Johnson who helps it on for Aguero to finish. Clinical.
 #Mancini:   Nasri could play better. The first time he came back to Arsenal, maybe he was nervous. Samir is a top player.   
Senior #afc source confirms a verbal exchange between Nasri and Frimpong in the tunnel at FT but says rumours of punches thrown are wrong.
Sat at Gatwick waiting to take off for Greece. Young Arsenal team to travel? Surely- rarely this season have #afc been free of pressure.
 Wenger:   Give the players who turn up tomorrow some credit - they will produce a good performance.   #afc 
 #Wenger on #Anelka:   You can expect a move but not necessarily to a club in England, from what I’ve heard.   #afc #cfc 
 #Frimpong:   After my injury, I felt I was never going to get a chance at Arsenal again...  but I managed to come back.   #afc 
Emirates Cup has been cancelled next year due to Olympics clash. #afc say pre-season competition will return as usual in 2013.
 #afc team: #Fabianski; #Djourou, #Vermaelen, #Squillaci, #Santos; #Frimpong, #Coquelin, #Benayoun; #OxladeChamberlain, #Chamakh, #Arshavin. 
 Clear message from   Gate 7   - the notorious Olympiacos support. #afc ://yfrog.com/nvfpwjvj  
Olympiacos 1-0 #afc. Djebbour gives the hosts the lead after Squillaci and Djourou fail to cut out through ball.
 Olympiacos 2-0 #afc Howler from Mannone. He clears, Fuster turns it goalwards and Mannone swings a left leg at it, misses and it goes in. 
HT 2-0. Olympiacos benefiting from awful #afc defending. Must do better in 2nd half as more goals look likely.
#Olmpiacos 2-1 #afc. Miquel's cross is chested down by Chamakh and Benayoun volleyed home.
FT 3-1. Late third settles it but odd atmosphere here as Olympiacos go out because of late Marseille winner. Didn't matter but #afc poor.
@AnthonyLeaver mufc had easiest group and failed. Had been getting away for it for a while. #afc in better shape by the day. All well?
Wilshere ups the bet with Defoe to 5k over who goes finishes higher between #afc and #thfc in talksport interview.
 #Wilshere says he'd be   delighted   if Wenger succeeded Capello as #eng boss. Not sure #afc would agree (Wenger has said he wouldn't anyway). 
 #Lehmann on Man City:   They play very boring football. We don't want to see Manchester City in the Champions League.   #afc 
Statue of Herbert Chapman unveiled at #afc's Emirates Stadium. ://yfrog.com/h2yd2cqfj 
Statue of Tony Adams (admittedly from a rubbish angle) #afc ://yfrog.com/h7br5hoj 
 Henry:   I never thought in my wildest dreams I would have a statue like this.   #afc 
 #Henry stops speech as he begins to cry. He says:   There you go - people say I don't show emotion but I am showing it now.   #afc 
#Henry's statue at Emirates Stadium. #afc ://yfrog.com/h32towij 
 #Wenger:   Santos will be out for at least 3 weeks. His ankle injury is worse than we first thought.   #afc 
 #Henry rules out return to Arsenal:   Playing? No, I am just here to train and I love being in London.   #afc 
#Wenger confirms Vermaelen will start at left-back against Everton tomorrow. #afc
 #Chamakh on French radio:   I'm 27 and I need to play. I won't leave in January, but I will take an important decision in June.   #afc 
Wow. I guess it doesn't always pay to win the group. AC Milan v #afc in CL last 16.
 #afc team v #mcfc: #Szczesny; #Djourou, #Mertesacker, #Vermaelen, #Koscielny; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Gervinho; #VanPersie. 
 So #afc unchanged from team that beat Everton. Likely to be Vermaelen at left back in that case but either way, 4 centre-backs in defence. 
#Song needs to be careful for #afc. Already booked and he is main main in midfield to stop powerful forward surges from YToure etc.
 HT 0-0. #mcfc shown more cutting edge but #afc work rate excellent in defence. Bad Aguero miss, Ramsey bright on the ball. First goal is key 
Maybe it is that bad. Miquel readying himself to come on... #afc
 Djourou limps straight down the tunnel. Koscielny now at right-back, Vermaelen at centre-back alongside Mertesacker, Miquel left back. #afc 
#mcfc 1-0 #afc. Silva close range header.
 Arshavin on for Walcott, who has been very disappointing this afternoon. #afc 
#Nasri named man of the match inside the stadium. Someone here has a sense of humour. #mcfc #afc
 Wenger says Djourou has a groin problem.   Usually that means the player is out for 21 days.   #afc 
Spoke to @13Szczesny13 after #afc game. Story in tomorrow's #LondonEveningStandard. Top lad to talk after defeat - often the one who does.
Spoken to FA this morning who confirm #Arteta is NOT suspended for #afc game against #avfc on Wednesday. Only had 4 bookings this season.
Gibbs not expected to be fit for #avfc game after medical assessment today. #afc back four set to be same that finished against #mcfc.
 @Arsenal_dJ No decision yet but if the strike goes ahead, think they will call it off. 
 Belated Season's Greetings to all. After a holiday hiatus, now heading through London for #ffc v #afc. Intriguing game. 
 #afc: #Szczesny, #Djourou, #Mertesacker, #Koscielny, #Coquelin; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Gervinho; #VanPersie. 
HT 0-1 #afc. Worth it and could be more. #ffc can't get Zamora in the game but good work rate suggests they'll give it a right go in 2nd 45.
Wenger's decision to take Walcott off greeted with cheers in #afc end. He was poor today. Rosicky on. Fulham pressing for an equaliser tho.
Arsenal so depleted in numbers that Squillaci is now on for the final 10 minutes. #ffc pressing hard for an equaliser.
#ffc 1-1 #afc. Arsenal fail to deal with a corner and Sidwell heads home from three yards out.
#ffc 2-1 #afc. Zamora volleys home inside the near post. Stunning comeback from Fulham.
 #Wenger:   They tried to get Johan a second yellow. In the end, he got it.   #afc 
Only admin and processing documents holding up #Henry loan. Time diff to New York (-5 hrs) isn't helping but should meet 12pm deadline. #afc
Few rumours flying around about Pienaar to Arsenal - no truth in it for now. Spurs received no offers and no contact between club and player
#Henry on the bench for #afc
 #Arsenal: #Szczesny, #Coquelin, #Squillaci, #Koscielny, #Miquel, #Song, #Arteta (c); #Ramsey, #OxladeChamberlain, #Arshavin; #Chamakh. 
Huge roar for #Henry as his name is read out by the stadium announcer... #afc
 Given Henry's return and the full-back injuries, I saw Lee Dixon in the press room. Doubt he brought his boots but #afc could do worse... 
 HT 0-0. First half felt largely like everything is on hold until #Henry arrives. #lufc working hard to stifle in midfield, #afc disrupted. 
 No14 is coming on!!! Oh, its Theo... #afc 
#afc 1-0 #lufc. #Henry scored. It had to be...
#afc 1-0 #lufc. Fairytale delivered. #Henry collects Song's pass and curls a clincal shot into the far corner. It had to be...
Ladbrokes tell me a few punters had read the script - #Henry's goal has cost them £100k tonight. #afc
FT 1-0 #afc. #Henry nets the winner and his 227th for Arsenal. Delirious scenes as he celebrates at the end. That's what they came to see.
 #Wenger:   Sagna and Gibbs could be back before the end of January.   #afc 
On @bbc5live shortly after 3pm as part of pre-match build-up to #Swansea v #Arsenal. Tune in if you can/ so wish.
#Arteta is set to miss #afc game v Swansea after picking up a knee injury in training. Benayoun his probable replacement. Not confirmed yet.
 #afc: #Szczesny; #Djourou, #Mertesacker, #Koscielny, #Miquel; #Song, #Benayoun; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Arshavin; #VanPersie. (Henry on bench). 
 #Swansea 0-1 #Arsenal. Arshavin slides a ball into #VanPersie, who beats Vorm a touch easily right-footed at his near post. 
#Swansea 1-1 #Arsenal. Sinclair converts after Ramsey is adjudged to have fouled Dyer. Only seen it once but looked very soft.
HT 1-1. Great start for Arsenal but Swansea been the better side since Sinclair's pen. All set up for #Henry again?
 Arsenal out early for the 2nd half. A rollocking, perhaps? Its Swansea who make a change though. Sigurdsson on for Agustien. 
 #Swansea 2-1 #Arsenal. Ramsey loses the ball carelessly and Swansea work it to Dyer, who smashes it past Szczesny. 
 #Swansea 2-2 #Arsenal. Djourou pass releases Walcott, who dinks a superb finish over Vorm. 
#Swansea 3-2 #Arsenal. Oh my. Graham is sent clear and he outpaces Koscielny before slotting a neat finish past Szczesny.
 OxladeChamberlain now on for Arsenal. Past (Henry), present (Van Persie) and future (the OC) now in tandem to try and salvage something. 
FT 3-2 Swansea. Superb display from Swansea full of resilience and character. #afc didn't have enough of either & need defenders back.
 #Wenger:   The referee gave a penalty was a complete imagination and a dive. Well done to him.   #afc 
Remarkable press conference. Wenger answered one question and got up to leave (police escort waiting). Answered 2 more as he walked out.#afc
 #afc official confirms incident between away fan shouting abuse at FT & Henry, who replied   Support your team.   Henry says was 'no big deal' 
 To give Wenger his due, after complaining about the referee, he did praise Swansea's display and admit to Arsenal's poor defending. #afc 
Boost for Arsenal. #Arteta and #Vermaelen winning fitness battles to face Man Utd on Sunday. Should be available barring any late setbacks.
@harryiscesc Transfer snippets?! Arsenal are doing nothing at the moment. Honestly. Its dead quiet.
#Arshavin will stay at Arsenal this month but looks set to leave the club in the summer. Full story here: ://bit.ly/yPQ6zR  #afc
 #Arteta had a setback- out for Sunday. Vermaelen facing fitness test, Henry also having fitness test, Sagna and Gibbs 2-3 wks away. #afc 
 @samuelj29060 More annoyed at #afc press office to be honest. They talked me round re Arteta. Still, these things happen. 
@dhicir Yep. Can only apologise. Was talked round re Arteta by #afc press office. Will be having words but my responsibility. Sorry.
 Henry has   very few chances   to be fit for Sunday, says Wenger at London Colney. Vermaelen has   a little chance  . #afc 
 VanPersie in #afc programme:   I'd never lost a match 8-2 before so I'm hungry to put that right, as is the entire team.   
 #afc: #Szczesny, #Djourou, #Mertesacker, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen; #Rosicky, #Song, #Walcott, Ramsey; #OxladeChamberlain; #VanPersie. 
#mufc monopolising possession now and gradually turning the screw. Decent Szczesny stop from Nani - #afc need a foothold in the game.
#afc 0-1 #mufc. Valencia on the stroke of half-time heads home Giggs' cross.
 HT 0-1 #mufc. Better side lead. Not an accident that 1 #afc full-back doesn't stop the cross, the other is beaten by Valencia. 
Djourou off at half-time. United had clearly targeted him in the first half. Can Yennaris do any better? #afc
Better from #afc. Staggering Torres impression from VanPersie as he misses a sitter before Ramsey fires over. Surely more goals in this?
Park and Arshavin imminent for #afc
 #afc 1-1 #mufc Flowing counter attacking move as OxladeChamberlain finds VanPersie, who levels after Rafael caught upfield. 
 #afc 1-2 #mufc Arshavin is beaten too easily by Valencia, who plays a 1-2 with Park and then feeds Welbeck, who smashed home, 
A number of fans sarcastically hand-clapping Wenger for Arshavin's poor defending in the build up to that goal. #afc
Now its Park off and Ramsey on. No booing of that decision #afc have six minutes to salvage something.
 FT 1-2 #mufc Decent second half fightback from #afc but poor defending cost them. Rarely, if ever, have I seen afc fans so irate at Wenger. 
 #Wenger:   I can understand that the fans are upset about the substitutions, especially when it doesn’t work. #afc 
 #Wenger: “I have been in this job for 30 years and I have made 50,000 substitutions. I do not have to explain every decision to you.   #afc 
@tonyneilson85 @timpayton @darrenarsenal1 @arseblog Their view may well be that he has kept Arsenal competitive without spending.
On Arsenal.com's Fans Forum tonight from 7.30-9. Should be a lively one given yesterday's events... #afc
@MuppetGooner I appreciate you have spent much longer watching Arsenal than me- shame you didn't enjoy the piece. Thanks for reading anyway.
 #Wenger:   Sagna, Henry and Arteta could be back in the squad.   #afc 
 #Wenger:   Wilshere has pain again in his ankle. He did it while running so we stopped it straight away. He's seeing a specialist today.  #afc 
 Arshavin and Henry among #afc subs. Chance for the Ox to build on his growing reputation. RVP starts- right call. Get ahead, take him off. 
 Winner of #afc v #avfc to play Sunderland or Middlesbrough in the FA Cup 5th round. #thfc travel to Stevenage, #cfc home to Birmingham. 
 Mixed reaction to Arshavin's name when read out. In fairness, he is announced immediately after Henry. Poor guy can't catch a break. #afc 
 #afc 0-1 #avfc. Dunne heads home after Villa work a short corner, great cross from Keane and Koscielny is beaten in the air. 
 #afc 0-2 #avfc. Fantastic finish from tight angle at the second time of asking by Bent. Ireland released him, Bent delivered. 
HT 0-2 #afc Boos ring out round stadium. Villa well-organised - nothing more - #afc abject in defence. Tall order for Henry to salvage this.
#afc 2-2 #avfc. Two in three minutes as Hutton's clearance hits Walcott and flies in following Van Persie's penalty.
Penalty to Arsenal.
#afc 3-2 #avfc Van Persie slots home again- the other side- after Bent brought down Koscielny. Remarkable turnaround.
 FT 3-2. #afc Stirring comeback as #avfc capitulated completely. The Ox superb, MOTM again and played without fear. Defence still shaky tho. 
Van Persie in the clear over alleged elbow on Cuellar. Sensible decision. #afc
 #Eisfield completes move to #afc. £600k, 4-yr contract. Miyaichi to join Bolton on loan until summer. That's it for Arsenal as it stands. 
#afc about to travel up to Bolton ahead of tomorrow's game. Been told #Arshavin is travelling with the squad.
...that club announced on Fri. Will be assessed in next 2 weeks to confirm comeback date. Club doctors NOT yet ruled him out for season.#afc
Remember those 'cold nights up north' Arsenal were famed for hating? I can confirm it is both 'cold' and 'up north' at the Reebok. #afc
Sagna starts for #afc. Team to follow.
 #Arsenal team: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Mertesacker, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Chamberlain; #VanPersie. #afc 
 #afc could be 3-0 up. RVP header off the line, Ramsey and the Ox waste good chances. What often happens next is the other side scores... 
 HT 0-0. Not sure how. #afc missed several golded chances. RVP, the OX, Ramsey all culprits. N'Gog wasted two at the other end. 1st goal key. 
 As pointed out by @MAYET_A, Walcott's miss probably the worst of first half. Back underway here, Arsenal start 2nd half on top. 
#bwfc playing almost entirely in their own half and looking to hit on the break but #afc can't quite open them up. 0-0 65 gone.
Superb by RVP - chips a delightful effort that hits the bar. Rosicky on for Ramsey. Time running out for #afc. #bwfc sensing a winner too.
FT 0-0. Entertaining. Best #afc chances never fell to RVP. Supporting cast fluffed their lines. N'Gog could have had 3 for #bwfc.
 #afc team: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Vermaelen, #Koscielny, #Gibbs; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey,   #Rosicky; #VanPersie. 
 Wilshere, Jenkinson and Santos all here in the San Siro tonight despite injuries to support #afc 
 Concerned about #afc left. Rosicky must be disciplined, Gibbs only just back. Also, think Ibrahimovic is overrated. He'll score 3 now... 
#Milan 1-0 #afc. Boateng scores with a superb volley in off the bar. The Spurs connection doesn't need mentioning.
 According to UEFA, #afc have had 53pc of the ball so far. It really doesn't feel like it. 
 #Milan 2-0 #afc Ibrahimovic is away down the left and he feeds Robinho, who finishes from close range. 
 #Milan 2-0 #afc. Ibrahmovic (responding to my jibe), Robinho and Boateng too much for Arsenal, who are defending badly and gifting the ball. 
 #afc pass completion 69pc from 211, Milan's 70pc from 197. Remarkable. I'm watching a different game. 
#Milan 3-0 #afc. Disastrous start to the 2nd half. Vermaelen slips allowing Robinho the space to fire home.
 Song going to centre half, Vermaelen left back as the Ox is on for Gibbs. #afc 
Been talking about #afc playing 4-4-2 for a long time - not sure this is the time to try it but an away goal would be a huge boost.
 #Milan 4-0 #afc. Djourou fells Ibrahimovic, who converts the spot kick. Tie surely over. 
#afc's worst ever Champions League defeat was 3-0 at home to Inter in 2003 and 3-0 away to Shakhtar in 2000.
 FT 4-0 Milan. Ibrahimovic led #afc a merry dance. Abject performance, wasteful, careless and error-strewn. A total disaster. 
Wenger furious with the 4th official at FT. Didn't know he was Arsenal's defensive coach...
I'm told its Arsenal's worst ever European defeat. Need to check that though.
Koscielny just walked through mixed zone fine enough. Didn't appear too serious but waiting for confirmation. #afc
Perhaps the most worrying thing for #afc is how predictable defeat to Sunderland was. Abject for the 2nd time in 4 days.
#Defoe stokes the fire and says north London derby means more to #afc than #thfc. Link to piece in tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/zP1n16 
#Arsenal set to announce freeze on season ticket prices for next season. 2 per cent rise in club level prices.
 #Arshavin loan to Zenit close to collapse. #Arsenal want loan fee, Zenit refusing. Personal terms done. Still time to agree but unlikely. 
 Koscielny could be fit to face Spurs, Gibbs doubtful, Ramsey, Coquelin out. #afc 
Interesting development in #Arshavin loan deal: Zenit have agreed to pay £1m fee on top of wages. #afc now have a decision to make.
Decision made. #Arsenal agree to loan out Arshavin until the end of the season. Zenit to pay wages & £1m fee. Race on now to sort paperwork.
 At Emirates. Odd team. #afc: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen, #Gibbs; #Song, #Arteta, #Rosicky; #Walcott, #VanPersie, #Benayoun. 
#afc 0-1 #thfc. Arsenal's defence is all over the place as Adebayor plays in Saha and his shot deflects off Vermaelen and in.
 #afc 0-2 #thfc Adebayor converts confidently after Szczesny is adjudged to have brought down Bale, who was looking for it. 
#afc 1-2 #thfc. Sagna heads home Arteta's cross moments after Van Persie hit the post. They deserve that for their effort.
#afc 2-2 #thfc. Incredible. #RVP collects Assou-Ekotto's poor clearance and works it onto his left foot to curl home a stunning effort.
HT 2-2. #thfc started with a poise that has evaoparted in face of #afc pressure. Penalty was big call - why no card? RVP superb. Great game.
#afc 3-2 #thfc. Rosicky scores after exchanging passes with Sagna and stealing in at the near post ahead of King.
#afc 4-2 #thfc. Walcott scores (and answers his critics) with a superb dinked finish from RVP's pass.
#afc 5-2 #thfc. Walcott scores again after collecting Song's through ball and beating the offside trap. This is absolutely mental.
 Parker sent off. Second yellow for bad challenge on Vermaelen, who refuses to shake Parker's hand by way of apology. #thfc #afc 
 FT 5-2 #afc Superb game, great comeback from Arsenal. #thfc fell apart from 2-0 up but several afc players answered their critics here. 
 #Wenger:   Arsenal is alive more than anybody thought before the game.   #afc 
 Wenger:   The crowd was starting to get on Theo's back but I felt he has the qualities that are highly needed.   #afc 
 Wenger:   It is possible to finish above Tottenham. They have a difficult schedule, so do we. It will be down to consistency.   #afc 
 #Redknapp on an altercation with Arsenal supporters:   It was one idiot. One guy. It was nothing really.   #thfc 
 #Redknapp on top four run-in:   Its going to be tight. We are still 7 points clear of Arsenal and Chelsea.   #thfc 
 #afc announce half-yearly profit before tax of £49.5m (6 mths to Nov 2011). Turnover up to £113.5m (from £97.6m), made £63m on player sales. 
On Arsenal TV's Fans Forum tonight from 7.30. I wonder which match we'll be discussing? Link here: ://www.arsenal.com/mondayfansforum 
 @grahamsm1th My brief was to write about Arsenal, not Spurs. Just enjoy the result. 
#afc announce pre-season friendly against #mcfc in Beijing. Friday July 27. Surely won't be the only game out there but only one confirmed.
Both Vermaelen and Van Persie to be assessed later today. Rosicky has a minor groin problem but is expected to play against Liverpool. #afc
 #Redknapp on the top four:   Its going to be tight but I'd rather be where we are than Arsenal. I want to finish third.   #thfc 
 #Wenger:   We paid a big price for Saturday. We have lost Benayoun, Diaby and Arteta. Rosicky is doubtful as well.   #afc 
 #Wenger:   We will play the best possible team. We will not accept (before the game) we are out of the Champions League.   #afc 
 #Wenger still angry about the San Siro surface.   You can tell Milan tomorrow we will play on a real football pitch.   #afc 
 Wenger confirms Van Persie will start tomorrow.   I wouldn't be credible in saying we can score five goals if I then don't play Robin.   #afc 
 #afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen, #Gibbs; #Song, #Rosicky, #Walcott, #Gervinho, #OxladeChamberlain; #VanPersie 
@EGGsays Can't see it myself. It is an odd Milan team though - a few changes which is encouraging for Arsenal.
#afc 1-0 #acmilan Koscielny heads home unmarked from a corner. Awful from Milan. Game on. Surely not...
 #afc 2-0 #acmilan. Rosicky scores after yet more woeful defending. Thiago Silva's dreadful clearance comes straight to Rosicky, who finishes 
Penalty to Arsenal
#afc 3-0 #acmilan. #RVP converts after Nocerino and Mesbah combine to bring down the Ox.
 HT 3-0 #afc. Magical. Arsenal inspired, Milan defensively disastrous. Concede and they'll need 6 but they could get them playing like this. 
#acmilan better this half but #afc still the more likely to score. 17 mins left to find 1 more to take it to extra time.
FT 3-0 #afc Heroic effort ends in gallant failure. Milan defended better in 2nd half but #afc restore pride in Europe.
 #Wenger:   We are disappointed because we touched qualification but we didn't do it.   #afc 
Rosicky gets reward for fine recent form with new 2-year deal with #Arsenal. Needs to keep it up now...
 At Emirates. #afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen, #Gibbs; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Rosicky, #OxladeChamberlain, #VanPersie. 
 #afc 0-1 #nufc. Vermaelen is sloppy in possession and Newcastle work it to Ben Arfa, who drifts inside Gibbs and beats Szczesny at near post 
#afc 1-1 #nufc. Instant response. Walcott finds Van Persie and Williamson tamely falls to the ground as RVP controls it and smashes it home.
I've never understood the point of Obertan. He's off and Ameobi is on. #afc bossing it but no way through as yet.
#afc 2-1 #nufc. Vermaelen wins it at the death. Remarkable conclusion. Momentum undeniably with them in the PL right now.
FT 2-1 #afc Dramatic conclusion but what they deserve for never giving in. Krul trying to get near RVP in the tunnel. Those 2 at it all game
 #Wenger:   Diaby is not far - small chance for Everton, Santos will play on Wednesday in the reserves, Jack (Wilshere) less imminent.   #afc 
Just arriving at Goodison Park for #efc v #afc. Big night in the PL. Stern test of Arsenal's revival awaits but 9 day break will help.
 #afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen, #Gibbs; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Rosicky; #VanPersie. 
@benashwell @Arsenal Thanks very much - very kind of you to say. Tough one at Goodison - think #efc cup exertions are a big advantage though
What a miss. Rosicky angles a ball into the box that RVP heads down and Ramsey lashes it over from about 10 yards out. Shocking. #afc
#efc 0-1 #afc. Vermaelen heads home Van Persie's corner. Reward for an authoritative start.
#Drenthe puts the ball in the net but he's flagged for offside. Replay shows he is clearly on - lucky escape for #afc.
HT 0-1 #afc Vermaelen caps superb display with goal. #efc show flashes but visitors largely in control. 3 harsh offside calls against #efc.
 FT 0-1 #afc. What a difference a back four makes. Visitors solid in defence and deserve win, tho #efc wrongly denied goal. 
 Podolski has passed a medical at #Arsenal. Deal expected to be announced early next week. £10.9m fee, four-year contract. #afc 
@awinbourne No need for the abusive language. Not sure how you work that out either- a lot of Arsenal fans accuse me of bias against them.
Podolski to Arsenal update. Deal is basically done but Cologne have asked to delay announcement for fear of fans' backlash. They lost..(1/2)
 Elsewhere, thanks for kind words about my column. What does the future hold for #afc's five frantic signings? ://bit.ly/HcE2mJ  
At London Colney for Wenger presser. Confirms Koscielny back in the squad to face QPR tomorrow. #afc
 #Wenge on UEFA charge:   I don't know if I am banned but if I am, it is unjustified and I will appeal.   #afc 
 #Wenger on UEFA charge:   I don't know if I am banned but if I am, it is unjustified and I will appeal.   #afc 
 Wenger says Vieira   spoke with his heart   when claiming Man Utd ref advantage and claims stats show Arsenal never get ref advantage. #afc 
 Exclusive Mikel Arteta interview in tonight's Standard. Escaping Cesc's shadow, the run-in & #afc dressing room songs ://bit.ly/HlBJhi  
 Arteta tells the Standard (or me, if you prefer):   I want to finish my career at Arsenal.   ://bit.ly/H0cRek  
 #Redknapp:   Man City have to win at Arsenal next weekend otherwise (the title race) is all over.   No pressure Roberto... 
 Exclusive Theo Walcott interview in tonight's Standard. We talk expectation, playing up front & his mean streak. ://bit.ly/Is5MSI  #afc 
At Molineux. I wonder which #Arsenal  side will turn up tonight- the resilient one as at Everton or the same one as at QPR? #wwfc #afc
@AshinAFC That should play into Arsenal's hands if you ask me. Wolves certainly need the points though but hard to see a home win.
 #afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Djourou, #Vermaelen, #Santos; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Benayoun; #VanPersie. Rosicky on bench. 
Penalty to Arsenal. Red card for Bassong.
 #wwfc 0-1 #afc Van Persie ends his 4-game goal drought with cheeky dinked penalty. Walcott burst through, Bassong clumsy. Definite contact. 
#wwfc 0-2 #afc. Walcott doubles the lead. Molineux an angry place right now. Lovely finish after 1-2 with RVP.
 #wwfc fans singing:   You've only scored two, you've only scored two...how s**t must you be, you've only scored two.   #afc 
HT 0-2 #afc. Utterly dominant after early penalty and Wolves red card. Home fans boo ref as he heads off. Looked a fair penalty call to me.
#wwfc 0-3 #afc. Benayoun drives the ball home from just outside the box after Song's pass. Harsh on the hosts who had been better this half.
 FT 0-3 #afc. Easy as you like for Arsenal after early sending off and pen. Game drifted in 2nd half, Wolves kept going but look doomed. 
 At Colney. Wenger responds to Sol Campbell claim #afc should spend more.   He has a lot of money- if he gives us some, we will spend it.   
 At the Emirates. #afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Djourou, #Vermaelen, #Santos; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Rosicky, #Benayoun; #VanPersie. 
 #afc 0-1 #wafc. From an Arsenal corner, Wigan score. They break away at pace and Di Santo finishes from Gomez's pass. 
 #afc 0-2 #wafc. Great run by Moses and Gomez forces the ball home. Arteta off, Ramsey on (presumably an injury). Unbelievable start. 
#afc 1-2 #wafc. Rosicky delivers a superb cross from the right and Vermaelen gets up to head home powerfully.
HT 1-2 #wafc. All #afc after those two early goals but not fluent enough in the final third. Shaky at the back too. Credit Wigan though.
 Given their PL status is at stake, Wigan are remarkably composed in possession. #afc trying to build momentum but missing Arteta's passing. 
FT 1-2 #wafc. Deserved win. Wigan scored early but always offered a threat and played with great spirit and quality. #afc poor all round.
#afc can complain about timewasting - and there was a lot of it - but in truth they looked like they could play all day and not score again.
Just seen Arteta walk to the players' lounge on crutches and with right foot in a protective boot. Doesn't look good. #afc
 At Emirates. #afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen, #Gibbs; #Song, #Ramsey; #Walcott, #Rosicky, #OxladeChamberlain;#VanPersie. 
HT 0-0. #afc missing rhythm provided by Arteta's passing in midfield. #cfc dangerous but vulnerable at set pieces. There to be won for both.
Cahill has been excellent for #cfc today. Forming a very good partnership with Terry. Maybe #afc should have made a bid for him. Oh...
FT 0-0. #afc lacked conviction to take the game to #cfc enough. Decent point for Chelsea given Barca matches. Chance for #thfc to capitalise
 #Wenger:   We didn't open them up enough and that is the regret I have today. It was similar to the Wigan game.   #afc 
 #Wenger:   It'll be tough for Theo to come back this season (for Arsenal). I think he will be alright to play for England (at the Euros).   
@AlexFortyNine Ajax want £10m and Arsenal are interested. Versatility would be a huge bonus for the club.
 @grahamsm1th Editorial policy? It's a column. I was at the Arsenal v Chelsea game, not at Spurs. Redknapp an issue but writing what I saw. 
 Thanks to all for such kind words about my column yesterday on @aaronjramsey and #afc. For anyone interested, it's here ://bit.ly/If7B7f  
@Sawyer_Arsenal Sure. But why?
@Sawyer_Arsenal By what? The FA approaching Hodgson? Always had a lot of respect for him - very harshly treated at Liverpool.
@timpayton He did needlessly bomb forward late on though - you can take the boy out of Arsenal...
Krul booked for timewasting just as he was against #afc. It came back to haunt #nufc that day. Will it again? 10 mins added time.
 #VanPersie:   We had a hard summer with Samir and Cesc leaving but we came back really well.   #afc 
 #VanPersie on future:   We still have to set a date but we still have to have a meeting, me, Ivan Gazidis and the boss.   #afc 
 #VanPersie:   Arsenal is an unbelievable club and the player I am today is because of Arsenal.   #afc 
 #VanPersie:   Whatever happens with me, I will always feel a Gunner.   #afc 
At Colney. Wenger rules out #VanPersie leaving this summer and is hopeful he will finish his career at #afc
 M'Vila £17.7m deal to #afc is close. Not done yet. Wenger hoping he will augment and not replacement Song, who is yet to agree a new deal. 
 Confusion over M'Vila. Player's camp claim deal (& fee) agreed, #afc sources say they are no longer interested. Am believing the latter now. 
... I may of course be wrong but #afc sources I trust insist no deal is likely. Wenger speaking to media at 12.30 tmw. May shed some light.
 #afc confirm assistant manager Pat Rice to leave the club at the end of the season.   Announcement on a successor to be made in due course.   
 At Colney. Wenger on Rice:   Arsenal was priviledged to have him as a player, captain and coach...   
 Wenger:   ... I would like him to forgive me for the bad moments I have given him as well.   #afc 
 Wenger confirms Steve Bould will succeed Pat Rice as No2.   He knows our football philosophy, therefore there will be continuity.   #afc 
Wenger says Walcott (hamstring) will resume training and have a fitness test tomorrow ahead of Sunday's trip to West Brom. #afc
 Wenger says there has been no contact with M'Vila, no interest at the moment and claims Arsenal are not close to buying anybody. #afc 
@SchwartzSaxon And you. Although I was at the Etihad so Arsenal coverage will be taken care of by others! Thanks for reading the paper.
 @WarrenHaughton In fairness, any team with Crossy in it is going to be Arsenal heavy... 
 As has been suggested elsewhere, Gazidis and Wenger will hold talks tomorrow with Van Persie to discuss a new contract. #afc 
 Wilshere on talkSPORT responding to Nasri's #afc trophy drought jibe:   Maybe he spoke too soon and we can rub it in his face next year.   
 #Wilshere to have   minor   knee op on   long-standing patella tendon issue   say #afc. Club claim it won't affect comeback from ankle injury. 
#afc standing firm over Van Persie. Making noises they'll run down contract if no agreement reached. Could change tact though as with Nasri.
 Djourou quoted in Switzerland today:   My situation at #afc is not easy. I’ve never played so little and especially not in my own position.   
 Zenit CEO Maxim Mitrofanov quoted in Russia on #Arshavin:   We believe that we've shown Arsenal how to deal with players as they train.   
@DarrenArsenal1 Fair enough. Don't think he has ever recovered from the United game in Arsenal terms.
 @timpayton Fair point. Yes, Arsenal appear to be doing good business early although RVP situation getting more ominous. 
 Fixtures out. Those involved know PL game after CL is key aspect of season. #afc's are M City a, WHam a, QPR h, Fulham h, Villa a, WBA h. 
 #mcfc have five out of six at home too following CL. Arsenal h, Sunderland h, Swansea h, Tottenham h, Chelsea a, Man Utd h. 
@Arsenal_SAfrica Yep. Definitely the media's fault we lost 4-1 to Germany two years ago.
@Arsenal_SAfrica Clearly you have never read anything I have written. Do your research before you cast aspersions.
 Arsenal complete #Giroud signing. He said: “I was attracted by the philosophy of football and Arsène Wenger’s 'touch' at this club.   
 On holiday but heard RVP news. Think #afc will demand he sees out his deal but if player wants to go, Juventus is his preferred option. 
@timpayton All seems alarmingly familiar. They need to resolve RVP situation asap. Bubbling along in the #afc boardroom too by all accounts.
Fulham interested in signing Andrey Arshavin after Arsenal tell him he is no longer required. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/PCRYI4 
 Meanwhile, #Cazorla confirmed by #afc. Club record fee of £16m - quite a statement but will it be enough to convince RVP to stay? 
Correction: It appears #afc got Cazorla for less than originally thought. Fee actually in the region of £12m. Decent price.
Walcott long considered himself a striker - might get a chance for England before Arsenal. Carrick in - does that mean he'll play regularly?
 On RVP, I think he will end up at #mufc. Arsenal holding firm over £25m price but it looks like a compromise will be reached eventually. 
Walcott out of #eng friendly tomorrow with a thigh problem - only precautionary. Expected to be fit for #afc this weekend.
 Despite public declaration, #afc would sell Song to Barca if price is right. 2 yr left on deal, no indication he'll sign a new one. Cash in? 
Some misinformation flying around about Song- spoken to #afc who confirm 3 years left on his deal. Point stands though...(1/2)
...It may be early but indication at this stage is he's unlikely to renew. And #afc are willing to sell if price is right.
 RVP to #mufc completed. All parties wanted it done before PL kicked off. For #afc, at least they avoided the same delay as when Nasri left. 
@PenfoldLawrence For who? Risky for both. At least Arsenal have bought earlier this time so they aren't short.
 On RVP, #mufc privately claiming »15m rising to as much as »22m with add-ons. #afc say »20m rising to as much as »24m. Who to believe? 
Losing Robin Van Persie and the challenges to Arsenal's philosophy in tonight's Evening Standard: ://bit.ly/Ps4FXY 
@StuTheGlu Not by nature but he's the most defensive-orientated midfielder #afc have.
 @NeilPayne This is Arsenal, you know the answer! 
 Wenger: Walcott fitness test this morning, Koscielny (calf) out, Cazorla travelling back from Puerto Rico and will be assessed. #afc 
 Wenger on Song leaving and a big name arriving:   Both could happen.   #afc 
@DarrenArsenal1 May take some time to come together but there's a lot for Arsenal to be optimistic about.
Breakdown in relationship between player and manager a considerable factor in Song leaving #afc. Wenger's remodelling continues.
 @attwood10 Liverpool convinced they will get Sahin, Arsenal too. Agent playing games I would reckon. Think he'll go to Arsenal as it stands. 
@attwood10 @AFCAMDEN @darrenarsenal1 Am off for a couple of days but my understanding was that he'll go to Arsenal.
 Update on Sahin to #afc: Wenger doubts Sahin can perform defensive midfield role. Agent looking for alternatives, #lfc interest revived. 
Sahin prefers move to Arsenal but Wenger mulling it over. Should all be sorted out in next 48 hours - #lfc interest will force a decision.
 Money, ambition definite issues but Walcott wants assurances he'll play more as a CF in future. Listed as a striker in last #eng squad. #afc 
 Park, Chamakh and Bendtner all not at #afc training ground today. Park left with   two big suitcases   apparently. Suggests exits are close. 
 Wenger:   Szczesny faces tests today and tomorrow, Koscielny back in the squad (to face Liverpool).   #afc 
 London CL draws: Group B: #Arsenal, Schalke, Olympiacos, Montpellier. Group E: #Chelsea, Shakhtar Donetsk, Juventus, Nordsjaelland. #UCLDraw 
Park understood to have passed a medical ahead of loan move from #afc to Celta Vigo.
Think Essien to #afc is unlikely. Club considered it but #cfc want permanent sale. Player would be keen but can't see it at this stage.
 Brilliant train service out of Euston for #lfc v #afc. Train delayed because of overcrowding. When I say brilliant, I really don't mean it. 
 #afc team: Mannone; Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Arteta, Diaby; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud. 
Mannone solid at Stoke but this a much bigger test. Sahin's #lfc debut another interesting dimension - Wenger decided not to sign him. #afc
Due respect paid to Bill Shankly today on what would have been his 99th birthday. Players out and we're nearly underway. #lfc #afc
#lfc 0-1 #afc. Lightning breakaway. Cazorla feeds Podolski who slots left-footed past Reina.
 HT 0-1 #afc Although #lfc edged opening exchanges, #afc had more end product. Fine Podolski strike. Both sides must improve in possession. 
 #lfc 0-2 #afc Cazorla beats Reina, a little too easily it has to be said, after playing a clever one-two with Podolski. 
 FT 0-2 #afc Huge result for Arsenal and their self-belief. Diaby superb, Cazorla, Arteta, Podolski all good. #lfc badly ran out of ideas. 
Diaby's role in #afc's win at #lfc offers hope Wenger's midfield transfer policy is right. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/SdHOSj 
Arshavin set to stay put at #afc despite interest from Russia (their transfer window closes tonight). Wants to fight for his place.
 Sagna quoted in L'Equipe criticising #afc transfer policy and hints he could be be next to go.   Could I be tempted to leave?... (1/2) 
   I just want to play again and be good again with Arsenal so far. Then, we will see. Each person has his own destiny.   (2/2) #afc 
Walcott facing fitness test after suffering a virus while away with England. #afc
 Met with #afc chief exec Ivan Gazidis yesterday. Aside from Wenger's contract, plenty discussed about the club's future. Story to follow. 
My interview with Ivan Gazidis on the future of #afc. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/PlBQIA 
 Arrived in Montpellier after 2 flights. Also on the 2nd plane was Carlos Velasco Carballo, tomorrow's referee between Montpellier and #afc. 
 Wenger says Szczesny is a doubt to face #mcfc on Sunday but   it is too early to tell   whether he will be out or not. #afc 
 Wenger says he is frustrated by his touchline ban but it   won't be an excuse for a bad result  . #afc 
 Q: What makes you convinced you will beat Arsenal tomorrow? Montpellier coach Girard:   I am not convinced we will.   
 Exclusive interview with Tony Adams.   #afc a feeder club   & explains why. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/S5bHSz  & ://bit.ly/S5bHCj  
 At the Stade de la Mosson. #afc team: Mannone, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Arteta, Diaby; Gervinho, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud. 
 At Stade de la Mosson. #afc: Mannone, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Diaby, Arteta; Gervinho, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud. 
Big night for Montpellier tonight. First CL group stage match. Their fans in good voice. Think #afc should win though.
Giroud gets a warm reception (as coach Rene Girard predicted yesterday) as his name is read out over the PA system here. #afc #mhsc
#mhsc 1-0 #afc. That's cheeky. Belhanda dinks it down the middle. No replays here but the penalty award looks harsh.
#mhsc 1-1 #afc. Fabulous move carves the home side open and Podolski slots home.
#mhsc 1-2 #afc. Jenkinson drives a cross into the six yard box and Gervinho forces it past Jourdren. Superb turnaround.
 HT 1-2 #afc Great response after Behanda's early Panenka pen. Diaby superb, Podolski epitomised work ethic. Job not done yet though. 
 UEFA now listing   good chances   on HT stats. Apparently neither side has had 1. And its 1-2 #afc. I'd have said a penalty was a good chance. 
Mixed reception as Giroud goes off. Ramsey on. Gervinho now CF. #afc are riding the storm well here. 77 gone
 Having said that, Belhanda has just missed a sitter. Not out of the woods yet. #afc 
FT 1-2 #afc Resilient display in the face of improved #mhsc 2nd half showing. Rode their luck at times but great start to Group B.
In tonight's Standard: Mannone on going to Hull and back in his bid to become Arsenal's No1. ://bit.ly/UcfzmP  #afc
Wenger confirms Szczesny is out for Sunday v #mcfc and for next 2-3 weeks. Same squad as Montpellier game. #afc
From today's presser: Wenger says Wilshere doubted he'd ever return ://bit.ly/Ul12W0  & #afc's title test at City ://bit.ly/PP3Qos 
At the Etihad in time to watch 2nd half of Liverpool v Man Utd in press room. #mcfc v #afc team news when available.
 #afc team: Mannone, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Arteta, Diaby; Ramsey, Cazorla, Podolski; Gervinho. 
 Two rather odd team line-ups here. Tevez on the bench, Sinclair starts. #afc reshuffle presumably with Podolski at CF and Ramsey on right. 
Vermaelen apparently has a virus and is replaced by Koscielny at centre half for #afc too.
 #mcfc 1-0 #afc Out of nothing, Lescott heads home Silva's corner. Mannone came and didn't get anywhere near it. 
 HT 1-0 #mcfc Harsh on #afc who were better side without creating a great deal. Mannone at fault for goal, towering header from Lescott tho. 
 #afc lacking an end product here. If only Wenger had a £12m striker to throw on... Problem is, Giroud badly lacking confidence. 
 And with that, Walcott and Giroud are readied on the #afc bench. 
#mcfc 1-1 #afc. Koscielny smashes it home after City fail to clear a corner. They had been turning the screw for a while.
FT 1-1 #afc deserved a point for their perseverance. #mcfc disjointed throughout. Two poor goals to concede defensively but a decent game.
Spoke to Arteta after game v #mcfc on his hopes for the season: ://bit.ly/Q0Hy3a  & my thoughts on #afc's midfield: ://bit.ly/Uy8H3p 
I don't often do this but... Walcott publicly admitted today that a contract issue with #afc is he wants to play as a CF. Wrote that in Aug.
@whatgap I phrased it as England should show the same patience as Arsenal have.
 #afc pre-tax profits of £36.6m for yr ending 31 May '12. Cash reserve of £153.6m but after costs & contingencies, Wenger has £40m+ to spend. 
 Arteta on his friendship with Torres and   unfair criticism   of the £50m striker. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/TLvOZf  #afc #cfc 
 Szczesny out for 2-3 weeks, Diaby out for three weeks, says Wenger. #afc 
 At the Emirates. #afc team: Mannone; Jenkinson, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Coquelin, Arteta; Ox-Chambo, Cazorla, Podolski; Gervinho. 
#afc 1-0 #Olympiacos Gervinho scores from 20 yards after the ball breaks to him on the edge of the box.
 #afc 1-1 #Olympiacos. Fabulous equaliser. Greco's pinpoint cross finds Mitroglou, who glances the ball into the far corner. 
HT 1-1 #afc a little too laboured in possession. Sloppy at times too and Olympiacos had the best chance prior to Gervinho's opener.
#afc 2-1 #Olympiacos. Podolski nutmegs the keeper from close range after Gervinho's cutback.
 Walcott on for the Ox. Inside the final 20 minutes, #afc ahead but Olympiacos still carrying a threat. 2-1 
3-1 #afc Ramsey races clear and finishes smartly left-footed. Flatters them a touch as its been largely uninspiring.
FT 3-1 #afc Ramsey finish (right-footed actually) seals a satisfactory night in terms of the result. Performance can be better though.
At Colney. Wenger says Mertesacker faces a fitness test ahead of trip to #whufc after a virus. #afc
 Wilshere to play his second reserve match next week as he steps up his comeback, says Wenger. #afc 
 Wolves interested in taking Frimpong on loan- Wenger says   he must regain his competitive edge   before making a decision. #afc 
Gibbs injury is a thigh strain. To be assessed over the next few days- doesn't appear a serious problem at this stage though. #afc #eng
Lennon on for Walcott after the #afc winger was clattered by goalkeeper Simoncini. #eng
At Colney. Wenger says Koscielny not available against Norwich with a bad back. Walcott also out - could be back for QPR. #afc
 Wenger warns it would be too early to call Jenkinson into the senior England squad against Sweden but   I'm sure he will be there.   #afc #eng 
Wenger laughs when told Pearce wants Wilshere to play at Under 21 finals for England next summer. #afc #eng
Wenger says Wilshere could return to first team action in Capital One Cup 4th round match against Reading on 30 October. #afc
At Colney. Wenger and Ramsey due to speak shortly to preview tomorrow's Champions League match against Schalke at Emirates Stadium. #afc
 Wenger: Chamberlain will not be back. The only player back is Koscielny. Wilshere will not be involved at all, not on the bench. #afc 
 Wenger says no update on Walcott contract situation.   My determination has always been the same - to extend his contract.   #afc 
 At Emirates. #afc team: Mannone, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Santos, Coquelin, Arteta, Ramsey; Podolski, Cazorla, Gervinho. 
Ramsey starting on the right of a 4-2-3-1 system for #afc.
HT 0-0 Cagey. #afc lacking cohesion in final third - Ramsey on right not working. #Schalke04 slick in possession but Huntelaar misfiring.
This game is being played how Schalke want it at present. Wenger needs to change things - #afc threat sporadic.
#afc 0-1 #Schalke04 Huntelaar scores.
Arshavin and Gnabry on for Podolski and Jenkinson. #afc have 7 minutes to salvage something. It doesn't look likely.
#afc 0-2 #Schalke04 Quick breakaway move. Jones feeds Farfan who squares it to Afellay. it came down the left. Who'd have thought?
 FT 0-2 #Schalke04 Deserved win. #afc abject going forward, porous at the back. Santos and Gervinho very poor. Boos ring round the Emirates. 
Schalke coach Huub Stevens says #afc still favourites to finish top of Group B.
 Bould:   We haven't performed tonight. We lack confidence for whatever reason. We looked jaded. I don't know why that is.   #afc 
Wilshere and Oxlade-Chamberlain could return against #qpr on Saturday. Bould not sure about Walcott's fitness. #afc
 At Arsenal's AGM. About to start. Speaking to a few shareholders beforehand, the atmosphere is volatile... 
 Gazidis:   Within the next two years Arsenal will have the financial resources to sit and compete with the biggest clubs in the world.   #afc 
That was very dismissive from Hill-Wood. Dissenters brushed over there. #afc
Kroenke says he has spoken to fan groups. He’s asked to name them. He can’t. #afc
 Wenger:   We hit the wall in the last two games in an unexplainable way.   #afc 
 Wenger on self-sustainability:   I wouldn’t be proud to take my wages at the end of the month just because somebody puts a cheque in.   #afc 
 Passionate plea from Wenger:   It is still important that we keep our strength and stay united for the good of Arsenal.   
PHW asked about Gazidis's salary increase and bonus: Bonus a reward for an “extremely good year”. #afc
 AGM concluded after 75 minutes with murmurs. PHW:   Thank you for your interest in our affairs.   #afc 
Back from a break with early flight to Germany. Big week for London clubs in CL. #Schalke04 v #afc tomorrow and #cfc v #Shakhtar on Weds.
 Wenger on Santos:   The swap of the shirt had nothing to do with our poor performance.   #afc 
 Wenger says Walcott has a stomach problem. Will he start?   I will not tell you that tonight.   #afc 
 Wenger:   I have a team of great players - at the moment they forget that a little bit.   #afc 
Walcott in from the cold as Wenger feels the heat. #Schalke04 v #afc preview in tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/QkqAlC 
Walcott starts for #afc v Schalke
 #afc team: Mannone, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Vermaelen; Arteta, Wilshere; Walcott, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud. 
All Schalke here. #afc struggling to get a foothold in midfield at present. Wenger opts to put on the fleece now with 15 minutes gone.
 #Schalke 0-1 #afc. Walcott scores, luckily, after Giroud fluffs  a one on one. 
#Schalke 0-2 #afc Podolski's cross finds Giroud with a diving header.
#Schalke 1-2 #afc Fine finish from Huntelaar puts Schalke back in it on the stroke of half time.
Pressure building here on #afc. Huntelaar denied by Mannone when clean through then a loud penalty appeal for handball is turned down.
#Schalke 2-2 #afc Farfan equalises
Wilshere on his hope #afc tie Walcott to a new deal. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/RIRIrB 
 At Great Ormond Street Hospital for press conference to open a new Lung Function Unit - #afc contributed £800,000 during the 09/10 season 
 Wenger speaking at GOSH:   We want to raise more money and help more charities. That's why we created the Arsenal Foundation.   
 Gibbs not fit, Gervinho, Rosicky and Diaby all unavailable. #afc 
 Szczesny will play a reserve game tomorrow against West Ham and if he comes through it Wenger   might add him to the squad  . #afc 
 Wenger on Wilshere's #eng call-up:   I had Roy Hodgson on the phone we found a good solution and a good compromise.   #afc 
Spoke to Vito Mannone about fighting off a fit-again Wojciech Szczesny to remain #afc's No1. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/Q1Iaep 
 Yes, quite right @10akhil & @christoronyi. And Arsenal have Chamakh. Somehow I didn't think that was worth mentioning... 
 Wenger:   Some people I have not seen yet like Cazorla who landed last night. I will need a few doctors this morning.   #afc 
 Wenger asked if #thfc getting closer to #afc. He replies:   I get this question every year.   
 Wenger says Arteta still No1 penalty taker despite #ffc miss. Interestingly, he says   on my list  , Podolski is No2 taker, Walcott No3. #afc 
 Wenger on Cazorla trip being   a long way to go for nothing:   You sum it up well. Sunbathing. It was 30 degrees (in Panama). #afc 
Sounds like Giroud is biggest doubt for #afc. Hamstring and calf problems. Lot of uncertainty with plenty of fitness tests after training.
 At Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Vermaelen; Arteta, Wilshere; Walcott, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud. 
#afc 0-1 #thfc Adebayor scores
#afc 1-1 #thfc Mertesacker powers a header past Lloris
#afc 2-1 #thfc Podolski's deflected shot squirms past Lloris. Had been all Arsenal since the red card.
#afc 3-1 #thfc Cazorla is fouled on the edge of the box but keeps going and crosses for Giroud to score.
HT 3-1 #afc Breathless 1st 45 defined by Adebayor. Scored then idiotic red card set #thfc on back foot. #afc impressive in turning it round.
#afc 4-1 #thfc Cazorla turns home Podolski's cross from close range. Game over.
#afc 4-2 #thfc Bale fires a shot past Szczesny. Surely nott....
#afc 5-2 #thfc Walcott adds a fifth in stoppage time. Decent finish from the striker-in-waiting.
FT 5-2 #afc Adebayor cost Spurs dear. Much better fluency from Arsenal and a needed shot in the arm for Wenger. AVB will count the cost.
 Wenger:   It looked like last year and then there was the turning point with the sending off of Adebayor.   #afc (That makes more sense) 
#afc 5-2 #thfc Match report on Standard website: ://bit.ly/T7HIcZ 
Finally landed in London & off to the Emirates. #afc should beat Montpellier. But they weren't entirely convincing against them in France.
 At the Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Vermaelen; Arteta, Wilshere; Ox-Chambo, Cazorla, Podolski, Giroud. 
 HT 0-0 Flat atmosphere, flat #afc display. Looked more likely to break through but laboured in possession. Montpellier not without threat. 
 #afc 1-0 #Montpellier Giroud does well to head down Vermaelen's cross for Wilshere, who finishes smartly past Jourdren. 
#afc 2-0 #Montpellier Stunning left-foot volley from Podolski after a one-two with Giroud. Great goal.
FT 2-0 #afc Sublime 2nd goal caps an otherwise workmanlike performance. Schalke beat Olympiacos so #afc are through to last 16. Job done.
 Wenger:   I haven't even spoken to Thierry yet about [a loan move]. I haven't sorted out in my head yet what I will do.   #afc 
 Wenger says Diaby out for three to four weeks, Rosicky back in team training on Monday, Gibbs is available again. #afc 
 Arsenal announce £150m, five-year deal with Emirates. Contract includes shirt sponsorship until 2018 and stadium naming rights to 2029. 
 Training kit also included in Emirates deal. Gazidis says #afc didn't want to   clutter shirt and training kit with different brands  . 
 Q: How much will this deal appease the fans? Gazidis:   That's not the point of this deal.   #afc 
Gazidis says Emirates will pay a sum up front so money can be made available for transfers next summer. #afc
 Gazidis rejects idea Emirates money could help reduce ticket prices.   I think we have been very responsible with our ticket pricing.   #afc 
Early flight to Athens ahead of Olympiacos v #afc. Pressure off in CL qualification terms but good display needed after Swansea defeat.

 Wenger on Walcott:   I am frustrated. The player knows what I want- he has to make up his mind.   #afc 
 Wenger expects Sagna to stay.   I don't understand the speculation. He has a year and a half left. Talks have been very positive.   #afc 
Off to Bradford for #afc's Capital One Cup QF tonight. Expecting a strong line-up. And an old fashioned cup tie in freezing conditions.
 #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Coquelin, Wilshere; Ramsey, Cazorla, Podolski; Gervinho. 
 Stadium announcer reading out the #afc team:   You won't have heard of many of these names...   
Bradford 1-0 #afc Free-kick delivered by Jones to the back post and Thompson volleys home.
HT 1-0 Bradford. Great effort from home side. Wells superb. #afc moving ball OK but need more in final third. Gervinho awful.
Chamakh on for Coquelin. #afc have less than 30 minutes to salvage this. 1-0 Bradford.
Rosicky and Oxlade-Chamberlain imminent. Final throw of the dice from Wenger. #afc
 Inexplicably, Gervinho is going to last the 90 minutes. Ramsey and Podolski go off. Immediately there is more urgency about Arsenal. 
 Bradford 1-1 #afc Cazorla ball into the box, Vermaelen equalises. 
1-1 End of 90 minutes. Vermaelen saves #afc for now. Bradford lost their goal threat when Wells went off. Extra time beckons.
1-1 End of 120 minutes. It goes to penalties. Big cheer from home crowd. Bradford deserve it. #afc on top in extra time but couldn't nick it
Bradford 1-0 #afc Doyle scores
Bradford 1-0 #afc Cazorla's pen is saved
Bradford 2-0 #afc Jones scores
Bradford 2-0 #afc Chamakh hits the post
Bradford 2-0 #afc Darby's pen is saved
Bradford 2-1 #afc Wilshere scores
Bradford 3-1 #afc Connell scores
Bradford 3-2 #afc Oxlade Chamberlain scores
Bradford 3-2 #afc Richie Jones sees his pen saved
Wenger's 16-year tenure at #afc hits new low as Bradford expose familiar failings. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/U7ndeK 
 At Colney. Wenger:   Giroud is back. Koscielny back into the squad today. Walcott? I don't know.   #afc 
 Wenger rules Diaby out of Christmas fixtures.   I cannot fix a (return) date because we are a bit in no man's land on that front.   #afc 
   ...the football doesn't work, you can't expect Stan Kroenke to intervene. Its my job to do that.   #afc 
At the Madejski Stadium. #afc can create some important momentum here tonight but both sides are low on confidence. ://bit.ly/UYv6lo 
Giroud on the bench for #afc
 #afc team: Szczesny; Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Arteta, Wilshere; Walcott, Cazorla, Ox-Chambo; Podolski. 
#Readingfc 0-1 #afc Gibbs crosses and Podolski finishes smartly. Poor defending though.
#Readingfc 0-2 #afc Podolski cross and Cazorla scores. With a header. Great ball but where was the marking?
#Readingfc 0-3 #afc Cazorla turns the ball home from Gibbs' header after Reading fail to clear their lines.
HT 0-3 #afc Boos ring round the Madejski. Reading have been awful. But Arsenal have played well to take advantage. A question of how many.
 #afc fans breakout into a brief chant of   Wenger, Wenger sign him up   after Walcott bursts clear. 
#Readingfc 0-4 #afc Superbly well worked goal finishes with Podolski crossing for Cazorla to tap home.
#Readingfc 1-4 #afc Le Fondre scores after Gibbs concedes possession as Wilshere slips over.
#Readingfc 2-4 #afc Kebe scores with Podolski playing him onside. Surely not...
Nope. #Reading 2-5 #afc Walcott gets the goal his performance deserves after more fine work from Cazorla.
FT 2-5 #afc Cazorla magical tonight. Front four always looked dangerous against a woeful #Readingfc side who still managed to score twice.
Expecting #afc's Boxing Day match against West Ham to be cancelled because of Tube strike. Likely to be re-arranged for end of January.
Some thoughts on Walcott and his link-up as a striker with Cazorla after #Readingfc 2-5 #afc. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/T4XgNT 
 At Colney. Wenger on #afc team news pre-Wigan:   No new injuries. It will be a very similar team to the team that played on Monday night.   
#afc drawn against Bayern Munich.
Arsenal have agreed framework of new 3-and-a-1/2 yr deal with Theo Walcott. Contract with lawyers- details TBC. Set to be announced next wk.
More on Walcott's new 3-and-half year deal with Arsenal in tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/Y94A0j 
 At Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Coquelin, Wilshere; Walcott, Diaby, Cazorla; Giroud. 
Tempted to open up a sweepstake on which minute Diaby will be forced off through injury. Surprised he is starting again. #afc
HT 0-0 Bartley's header against the crossbar the nearest anyone has come. #afc started OK but lacking cohesion. Vermaelen close at the end.
#afc 1-0 #swans Wilshere scores. Finally.
FT 1-0 #afc Wilshere MOTM performance capped with a fine goal. Deserved win having dominated for long periods. #swans looked jaded.
Wenger confirms Arteta and Rosicky out for Sunday's trip to Chelsea. #afc
 Wenger confirms #afc   are looking   at Zaha but club have not made a bid yet. Asked about Cavani - says   I like him. He would cost a lot.   
 As some have pointed out, Cavani signed a new Napoli deal last year with circa £50m buyout clause. Puts selling club in strong position.#afc 
 At Stamford Bridge. #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Coquelin, Diaby; Walcott, Wilshere; Cazorla; Giroud. 
#cfc 1-0 #afc Mata scores.
Seen that tackle again now - clear foul by Ramires on Coquelin. #cfc fortunate but #afc defending still terrible for Mata's goal.
#cfc 2-0 #afc Lampard scores after Szczesny fouls Ramires.
 By the way, that's how to stop the Di Matteo chants at the Bridge - get a penalty and score in and around the 16th min. #cfc all over #afc. 
 #cfc fans singing   Arsene Wenger, we want you to stay.   #afc 
 HT 2-0 #cfc Thoroughly deserved, could have been more. #afc porous and toothless. But 2-0 not a done deal here, as Southampton game proved. 
#afc team out early for the second half. Riot act may well have been read.
#cfc 2-1 #afc Walcott scores from Cazorla's pass.
Fine finish from Walcott. #afc rewarded for improved display since HT. Fascinating final half hour in prospect.
#cfc fans baying for changes here. Rafa still does nothing. Torres trying but surely Ba has to come on. #afc looking more likely to score.
 Believe it or not, Arshavin is about to come on. #afc 
FT 2-1 #cfc Decent fightback from #afc but ultimately left themselves with too much to do after a dreadful start. Boost for Rafa to hold on.
 Wenger:   It was a free kick on the first goal and not a penalty on the second goal so we were a bit unlucky.   #afc 
 Wenger:   The team has to believe more in the quality that we have....We cannot afford to drop more points. [The table] is a concern.   #afc 
 #cfc 2-1 #afc Thoughts on Arsenal & the window, Torres and why both clubs may come up short. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/10hcKQc  
 At Colney. Wenger:   Coquelin is out with a hamstring problem. We could have Podolski and Oxlade-Chamberlain back in the squad.   #afc 
 Wenger:   The position we are in now is backs to the wall. We have to respond. The team was very down after the Chelsea game.   #afc 
 Wenger:   If Zaha goes to Man Utd, good luck to him. We were never in for him. Never.   #afc 
 Wenger confirms #afc still looking to bring in two players this month.   I will not give you any names. We are working very hard.   
 #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Ramsey, Wilshere; Walcott, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud. 
 So, Diame on the bench for #whufc & Diaby left out by #afc. Makes the midfield battle intriguing - important role for Ramsey. 
#afc 0-1 #whufc Great strike from Collison after Arsenal fail to clear a corner.
#afc 1-1 #whufc Cracking strike from long range by Podolski.
HT 1-1 #whufc causing problems with every ball into the box but #afc's pace/passing also a threat. Fine strikes from Collison & Podolski.
#afc 2-1 #whufc Giroud scores
 #afc 3-1 #whufc Podolski finds Cazorla, whose flick trickles over the line. 
#afc 4-1 #whufc Walcott scores from Podolski's fine cross. Arsenal running riot now.
 #afc 5-1 #whufc Podolski cross, Giroud slides the ball home. Super stuff from Arsenal. Four goals in 11 minutes. 
Diame comes on for #whufc...& is cheered by a considerable number of #afc fans. Clearly they think he's about to become an Arsenal player...
12 minutes added time here. #afc #whufc
FT 5-1 #afc Stunning four-goal burst just after HT settled this. #afc rediscovered their fast-paced football. #whufc outclassed in the end.
Thoughts on #afc 5-1 #whufc here: ://bit.ly/WQ26Pq  & spoke to Podolski about Arsenal's need for more consistency: ://bit.ly/WQ1RUw 
Awaiting Wenger presser at Colney pre-Brighton FA Cup game. Not expecting any major revelations about new signings but you never know. #afc
 #afc team news for Brighton. Wenger:   We will not be able to use Vermaelen tomorrow (ankle). Arteta, Coquelin out but Diaby, Rosicky fit.   
 Wenger:   We have been linked with David Villa like Chelsea but there is nothing there. We are not on the case.   #afc 
 Wenger:   We are not on any French player’s case. You can cut them out. You should go to Newcastle!   #afc 
 Wenger on ballboy incident:   Both were in the wrong....Hazard went in too strongly but I don't think he wanted to hurt the boy.   #afc 
 Wenger wants changes to January transfer window.   You should cut it out [altogether] or limit it to two players for each club.   #afc 
 Wenger compares Giroud to Alan Smith.   Maybe he can develop into this type of player.   #afc 
FA Cup 5th round draw: Arsenal v Blackburn.
 Interesting Usmanov quotes in L'Equipe today:   Thierry Henry is pushing me to buy all of Arsenal's shares but I can't predict the future.   
Alisher Usmanov claims Thierry Henry wants him to buy Arsenal outright. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/TLyhDF  #afc
 At Colney. Wenger:   Vermaelen is back, Arteta and Coquelin are still out. All the rested players are back.   #afc 
 Wenger on Beckham:   He has asked to come here and work on his fitness. He has not done anything for a long time.   #afc 
 Wenger on Beckham:   He called me. Itis purely for fitness. There is no speculation of signing him or anything.   #afc 
 Q What do you get out of Beckham training here? Wenger:   Nothing. Questions in a press conference.   #afc 
 Wenger on Villa:   Barcelona doesn't want to sell David Villa - they have made that very clear.   #afc 
 Q Is there any room for negotiation with Barca on David Villa? Wenger:   No.   #afc 
Arsenal have announced ticket prices will be frozen for 2013-14 season. Club level season ticket renewals begin on February 12. #afc
@OliverKayTimes @SamWallaceIndy True. But even Arsenal couldn't justify a further increase given recent performance/current climate.
 Liam Brady to step down as #afc academy chief by May 2014, club confirmed today. Big loss of a highly regarded coach. 
 At Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Ramsey, Wilshere; Walcott, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud. 
Some pre-match reading on #afc v #lfc and Aaron Ramsey's midfield role. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/VXgExs 
#afc 0-1 #lfc Suarez scores
That goal was a mess from a defensive point of view. #afc failing to clear their lines. #lfc reward for pressing high up the pitch.
 HT 0-1 #lfc pressing well prompting #afc panic. Chaotic defending from Arsenal undermining their efforts in attack. Suarez, Gerrard good. 
#afc 0-2 #lfc Henderson somehow bundles his way through and scores at the second attempt.
#afc 1-2 #lfc Giroud heads home Wilshere's free-kick. Poor defending. Giroud drifted off Agger.
 #afc 2-2 #lfc Walcott smashes it home and from absolutely nowhere, Arsenal are level. 
 FT 2-2 Usual mixed bag from #afc. Can play superbly in patches, defensively poor. #lfc should have put it out of sight before they tired. 
 Wenger:   Gibbs has a thigh strain and will be ruled out for three weeks. It is a big blow for us.   #afc 
 Q Will you sign anyone? Wenger:   I cannot promise you that. We ask for an official extension of the transfer window for one week!   #afc 
 He's joking, by the way. Wenger also once again ruled out any move for David Villa. #afc 
   ...were the reasons why he decided to buy shares in Arsenal.   #afc 
 Arshavin will remain at Arsenal as things stand. Turned down a move to Reading, #afc keen to get him off the wage bill but no takers yet. 
Walcott will note the irony that he's listed as a midfielder for #eng again having been a striker in previous squad & for #afc at times.
 #afc in talks with Malaga for Nacho Monreal. Fee not agreed yet. 1st choice ahead of Gibbs when fit? Either way, it demotes Santos... 
Monreal would be cup-tied for the Champions League this season. #afc need to strengthen there regardless.
#afc confirm Nacho Monreal deal is done.
 At Colney. Wenger:   Our scouts have followed Nacho's progress for a while. Gibbs out for longer than expected. It will be 4-6 weeks.   #afc 
 Wenger on Beckham move:   It just shows you how efficient we are with our training. He trained once and now he's at PSG!   #afc 
 Asked Wenger - did you teach Beckham any French? Wenger:   No. He has a lot to do!   #afc 
 Wenger on replacing Liam Brady at youth academy:   Patrick Vieira can be a candidate if he chooses - all the former players can.   #afc 
 Wenger admits he is worried about burnout with Wilshere.   I had expected Jack only to play a part of the game on Wednesday.   #afc 
 It appears Andre Santos has left #afc & joined Gremio on loan. Surely means Vermaelen plays at LB in CL v Bayern (Gibbs inj, Monreal inelig) 
Nayim is the half-time guest at WHL. Introduced with video of Real Zaragoza goal against Arsenal in 1995 Cup Winners' Cup Final. #thfc
 At Colney. Wenger:   Wilshere and Koscileny have tests this morning. Wilshere is 50-50. Vermaelen should be back - he is 90-10.   #afc 
 Wenger:   Andre Santos moved because he had lost confidence. He needs to play. He is a very good player but didn't get enough games.   #afc 
 Wenger:   Of course Santos can have a future at Arsenal - that depends on the ins and outs in the summer.   #afc 
 Wenger says Gibbs has small chance to be fit for 2nd leg against Bayern Munich   if all goes well  . #afc 
 Wenger plays down David Villa link (again): 'I am not on the case. I like the player but at the moment we have some immediate targets.   #afc 
 Wenger bullish on #afc CL prospects:   If we get past Bayern, we’ll say ‘why should we not go further and win it?   
Wenger says Arsenal could rule Europe if they beat Bayern Munich in the last 16. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/VVBeSO 
At Colney. Koscielny not training today. Club say its precautionary and should be OK for Bayern. #afc
 Wenger CL presser.   Monreal is not available, Mertesacker will be back in the squad. There is an uncertainty about Koscielny.   #afc 
 Wenger:   I trust our quality, our spirit and our mental strength. So, see you tomorrow.   #afc 
 Stormy Wenger presser.   We live in a democracy of experts & opinions. There are a lot of experts who are not exactly right.   #afc 
 Wenger:   I have been accused of not taking the FA Cup seriously. I have won it four times. Who has won it more?   #afc 
 Wenger:   We have been accused of not putting a strong team out. That is an insult to the players who started the game.   #afc 
Wenger denies contract talks & hits back at #afc critics: ://bit.ly/Uz0QTI  & comment on today's turbulent presser: ://bit.ly/Uz1gtg 
 At Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Vermaelen; Arteta, Ramsey; Cazorla, Wilshere, Podolski; Walcott. 
Giroud on the bench so presumably Walcott up front. He's wanted to play there in a big game for a long time. Tonight is his chance. #afc
Some pre-match reading if required. #afc have faltered in big games with slow starts. Cannot do so tonight. ://bit.ly/XL30eU 
#afc 0-1 #Bayern Kroos fires home from the edge of the box. Disastrous start for Arsenal.
#afc 0-2 #Bayern More bad defending. Van Buyten's header is saved but Muller forces it over the line. Bayern are good value for it.
 HT 0-2 #Bayern. Gulf in class obvious. #afc undone by poor defending as much as anything. That said, Bayern composed & authoritative. 
#afc 1-2 #Bayern A goal from nothing. Bayern switch off from a corner and Podolski nods home.
Rosicky and Giroud imminent. #afc
 How Arsenal should have lined up? Walcott crosses from the right, Giroud's first touch is a fine effort blocked by Neuer. 
 #afc 1-3 #Bayern Lahm's cross from the right, Mandzukic and Sagna try to meet it, the ball loops up and drops in the net. 
FT 1-3 #Bayern A galling night for #afc. Outclassed & undone by dreadful start. Bayern oozed confidence. Mission impossible in the Allianz.
UEFA stats: Arsenal 55pc possession. Completed 528 passes to Bayern's 363. Sagna (89pc) & Mertesacker (86pc) higher than any Bayern player.
 Wenger:   Let's not hide the truth, it will be extremely difficult (to qualify). We have to give our best.   #afc 
 Q Do you need to buy new defenders? Wenger:   Is that information or an opinion?   #afc 
 Asked Wenger how to stop nerves.   That is a difficult question to answer. Results...its a vicious circle.   #afc 
How did Arsenal get to this point? Thoughts on #afc 1-3 #Bayern. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/Y6QQkE 
 At Colney. Wenger:   Sagna is out with a knee problem. Everybody else should be alright.   #afc 
 Wenger:   The board meeting speaks about many things. Commercial, ticket prices, long term plans and I make my report. It was usual.   #afc 
 Wenger:   Its not feeling sorry for ourselves that will change the situation.   #afc 
 Wenger:   I explained why I was angry on Monday but I have calmed down. You have calmed me down.   #afc 
 Wenger says talks over new contract for Sagna ongoing.   We did not get the vibe   that he wants to leave. #afc 
 Wenger:   Financially we can live with not being in the CL. On the sporting side, no. And the sporting side is the priority.   #afc 
 #afc's latest financial figures to be announced today. 6 months end Nov 2012. Expecting good profit, boosted by player sales (as usual). 
 Arsenal announce £17.8m pre-tax profit for 6 months ending Nov 30, 2012. Cash reserves at £123m. Profit on player trading £23.2m. #afc 
#Arsenal match against #Everton on March 9 will now be played on Tue 16 April after the Toffees reached the FA Cup quarter-finals. #afc
Exclusive: Marc Overmars keen on return to #afc in backroom set-up. Currently Tech Director at Ajax. In the Standard: ://bit.ly/Vd2drN 
 Wenger:   Diaby will have tests today. I will decide if he will in the squad. It is 50-50.   Sagna ruled out against #thfc #afc 
 Q Will Sunday determining who finishes higher? Wenger:   Not necessarily, no. There are still ten games to go.   #afc #thfc 
 Q Will you need to plan for Bale? Wenger:   We don't plan for anybody.   #afc #thfc 
 #afc team: Szczesny, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Monreal; Arteta, Wilshere; Walcott, Cazorla, Ramsey; Giroud. 
#thfc playing rerun of Monday's game at #whufc on the big screens. A reminder for #afc players (if they needed one) of Bale's current form.
 Both managers smiling as they embrace before kick-off. Podolski & Holtby, Kaboul & Koscielny chatting too. #thfc #afc 
#afc started much better than in recent big matches. #thfc struggling to find space to play in compact midfield area. 0-0 15 gone.
#afc pressing high up the pitch with very good intensity. Prompting #thfc into errors - they've not really got going yet.
#thfc 1-0 #afc Bale is put through by Sigurdsson and the Welshman sidefoots past Szczesny.
#thfc 2-0 #afc Lennon is sent clear from Parker's pass. He rounds Szczesny and scores. White Hart Lane erupts.
 #afc fans respond:   Arsene Wenger, he's won more than you.   
HT 2-0 #thfc Clinical finishes from Bale and Lennon. #afc were better side when they pressed the ball. They stopped & conceded twice.
#thfc 2-1 #afc Mertesacker heads home from a corner and Arsenal are right back in it.
Jenkinson appeared to be injured and comes off. Rosicky on with Ramsey switching to right-back for now. #afc
 Arteta off, Podolski on. Fair to say Wenger is going for it... #afc 
Six minutes added time. #thfc #afc
 FT 2-1 #thfc Huge win for Spurs, who move back into 3rd and 7 points ahead of #afc, who paid the price for poor defending once more. 
#thfc 2-1 #afc match report at Standard Sport. ://bit.ly/YHXE4z 
 Wenger:   We were not efficient in the zones where it mattered (at either end). We were not dominated. It was a strange game to lose.   #afc 
 Wenger:   I don't know anything about it (Middle East takeover). Are the owners interested to sell or not? I don't know.   #afc 
 AVB:   It is not a big enough gap to be completely safe. But it could have an effect on their (Arsenal's) motivation.   #thfc #afc 
Not yet a power shift but telling that #thfc are happy as they are while #afc need change. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/YPCBzh 
@highburyfan86 Can only talk of a genuine power shift if Spurs finish above Arsenal for a couple of years & win trophy/trophies.
Looks like a slight tactical tweak tonight. #thfc have gone 4-2-3-1 to match up with Inter. Often looked more 4-4-1-1 against #afc.
 @SK92RD Minimal, to be honest. Arsenal must score first. And early. But hard to see them pulling it off. 
#afc order rest for Wilshere to avoid risk of repeat ankle injury (to his opposite ankle). In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/10A72uq 
At the Allianz Arena in Munich. Awaiting Wenger and Vermaelen to address the media prior to tomorrow's 2nd leg v Bayern. #afc
 Wenger on leaving Szczesny out:   It is to rest him. Recently I have felt mentally [the games] have affected him a little bit.   #afc 
 Wenger:   It is his second season in the PL and he has played many games. You have a big squad and that's why sometimes you rotate.   #afc 
 Wenger:   A big club is to be always present at the top and one year it will go for us like it went for Chelsea last year.   #afc 
 Wenger:   I have a great respect for this team and their attitude. They have not been rewarded yet.   #afc 
 At the Allianz Arena. #afc: Fabianski; Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Ramsey; Walcott, Rosicky, Cazorla; Giroud. 
Awaiting kick-off in the magnificent Allianz. Some pre-match reading (via @standardsport) previewing #fcbm v #afc: ://bit.ly/XuJdr5 
Some Lukasz Fabianski stats. Last #afc start: Sunderland away (FA Cup) Feb 18 2012. Last clean sheet: Man City home (PL) Jan 2011. Good luck
#fcbm 0-1 #afc Now then. Rosicky feeds Walcott who crosses dangerously into the box and Giroud slams it into the roof of the net.
HT 0-1 #afc. #fcbm missing Schweinsteiger more than Arsenal miss Wilshere. Much better & more resilient from #afc.
Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gervinho coming on. Ramsey and Walcott coming off. Arsenal have 19 minutes to score twice. #afc
#fcbm 0-2 #afc Koscielny forces the ball home. Arsenal have four minutes to get another.
FT 0-2 #afc  Valiant display by Arsenal but they go out of the CL on away goals (3-3-on agg). A lot of pride restored with that.
#fcbm 0-2 #afc. Match report (via @standardsport): ://bit.ly/15NeLbn 
#fcbm 0-2 #afc Wenger's dilemma for final 10 games after CL exit. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/10KAvSl 
Spoke to Mikel Arteta last night after #afc's CL exit. He was typically forthright. In tonight's Standard: ://bit.ly/Z5BXi9 
Two London derbies. Close call but opted for #cfc v #whufc. Chelsea could restore 5pt buffer from #afc with a win. W Ham could go 10th.
 @quatermass_pitt Yep, for Fiorentina. Good player. Arsenal keen on signing him. 
 At Colney for Wenger pressure. Wilshere's fitness, Szczesny's future & Reading on the agenda among others. #afc 
   ...and I don't know about him because we haven't seen him for 3 days. Diaby has a problem we need to check.   (2/2) #afc 
 Wenger on Wilshere:   We are a bit more cautious with him than with you or me. Especially you.   #afc 
 Wenger says Wilshere   will be back in two weeks  . Won't confirm who will start in goal but says   I know what I want to do  . #afc 
 Wenger on Wilshere:   We deferred his rehab and gave him an extra week's rest. medically, it was wise to do it.   #afc 
 Wenger on Wilshere:   The country doesn't depend on one player. It would be too much pressure to say [England's] future depends on him.   #afc

 Wenger:   Walcott and Wilshere are back and that is a plus for us. Rosicky has a test today and I hope he will be fit.   #afc 
 Wenger on signing Ashley Williams:   There is no truth in anything at the moment because we are not on the transfer market.   #afc

Arriving at the Emirates for #afc v #efc. Looking forward to this. Feels like it will have a big bearing on CL qualification for both clubs.
 @sukhy_bahra Really tough one to call. Don't know which Arsenal will turn up or, for that matter, which Everton will turn up. 
 #afc team: Szczesny; Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Ramsey; Walcott, Wilshere, Cazorla; Giroud. 
HT 0-0 #efc physical but effective. Gibson fortunate not have gone. #afc stifled but Giroud missed glorious chance from about 6 yards out.
FT 0-0 Good night for #cfc and #thfc in top four race as #afc draw a blank against #efc. Giroud guilty of several bad misses. Decent game.
 Wenger:   In the first half, the referee didn’t deal at all well with the intimidating physical challenges.   #afc 
Some thoughts on #afc 0-0 #efc and a Hard Day's Night for Giroud. Via @standardsport: ://bit.ly/ZqNHx2 
 Wenger:   Fabianski is out. Otherwise we have a few knocks and bruises but I'm confident everyone will be fit.   #afc 
 Wenger says   there is no buy back clause in   Alex Song's contract from Barcelona.   I'd advise him to give it another year.   #afc 
Blow for #afc that Goetze has agreed terms with Bayern. Arsenal monitoring him for a while. Think other positions a greater priority though.
 @RorySmithTimes Think you are right. Also, #afc interest pre-dated Cazorla and waned a little since. Jovetic high on the wish list now.

At Colney for Wenger presser. Hard to get away from RVP as the big talking point. #afc #mufc
 Wenger:   Fabianski is out. That means Szczesny will play.   Giroud suspended. #afc 
 Wenger:   I want the player to be respected, like some players who left with even more controversy than Robin van Persie.   #afc 
 Wenger on RVP:   You always miss a big player and it took us a while to get around it.   #afc 
 #afc can have no regrets over Van Persie sale, says Wenger. Via @standardsport: ://bit.ly/11JmLHP  
Painful truth for Arsenal fans is that Van Persie had to leave to be a winner. Comment via @standardsport: ://bit.ly/11Jn31t 
At the Emirates. Robin van Persie starts for #mufc. Full team news shortly. #afc
 #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs, Arteta, Ramsey, Walcott, Rosicky, Cazorla, Podolski. 
Guard of honour well observed as far as I could see. #mufc #afc
#afc 1-0 #mufc Walcott beats the offside trap and then De Gea. Looked marginally offside.
#afc 1-1 #mufc Van Persie converts from the spot. Muted celebration.
HT 1-1 #mufc way off the pace as #afc on top for much of the 1st half but RVP earns United parity.
 Podolski off, Gervinho on for Arsenal. 
 FT 1-1 #mufc the better side as the match wore on. #afc looked jittery at times in 2nd half, point leaves them fourth, 2pts ahead of #thfc.

 That said, I believe PSG interest in Wenger is genuine. But #afc confident of keeping him until 2014. What happens after is less certain. 
Had it confirmed by officials at Arsenal that @patrickrice1949 is a fake account. Pat Rice not on Twitter.
 At Colney for Wenger presser. Confirms Fabianski is not back.   The squad will be similar [to the Man Utd game].   Giroud suspended. #afc 
 Wenger on Walcott wanting to play CF:   Whether Walcott plays right or central is not a big difference to me.   #afc 
 Wenger on his future at #afc beyond current deal [which expires in 2014]:    I want to stay if I do well, if the club considers I do well.   
Wenger drops clearest hint yet he could stay at Arsenal beyond 2014. Via @standardsport: ://bit.ly/1070lh0 
 AVB on Szczesny claim #thfc lack quality to be in top 4:   It would have been a bit more tolerable if it had come from a genuine #afc fan... 
 More AVB:   Coming from an #afc player, he's a player who is probably passing by to another club or who is not going to stay there for life.. 
 AVB:   An #afc fan just arrived in that club for the last couple of years is entitled to so much hatred towards #thfc like he seems to have.   
 As many have pointed out, Szczesny joined Arsenal academy in 2006 so been there a while. Made his first team debut in Sept 2009. #afc #thfc 
 Table is now: 3. Chelsea 69pts, 4. Arsenal 67pts, 5. Tottenham 66. All now played 36 games. Out of #thfc's hands. 
FT 1-2 #thfc Huge win for Spurs. They move above #afc into fourth ahead of the Gunners' game in hand against Wigan on Tuesday.
 AVB asked whether he will watch #afc v #wafc on Tuesday. He laughs and says:   I'm not sure.   #thfc 
At Wenger for #afc presser pre-Wigan. Pressure on Arsenal to deliver tomorrow night after #thfc win yesterday.
 Wenger:   We have from the last game everybody available. Fabianski is back in the squad, Gibbs could be back in the squad as well.   #afc 
 Wenger:   We are in a position where our destiny depends on us and we want to finish the job.   #afc 
 Wenger on Ferguson:   It is sad because its the end of a remarkable career. He got a lot of praise that he deserves.   #afc 
 Wenger:   I was not surprised and I told my staff a long time ago it would be Alex Ferguson's last year.   #afc 
At Emirates Stadium. Huge night for #afc and #wafc. Some pre-match thoughts on Podolski & Walcott via @standardsport: ://bit.ly/16xsV3t 
 #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Ramsey; Walcott, Rosicky, Cazorla; Podolski. 
#afc 1-0 #wafc Podolski is left completely unmarked to nod home a corner.
#afc 1-1 #wafc Arteta was adjudged to have fouled Maloney and the same player steps up to hit a superb free-kick into the corner.
 HT 1-1 #afc came out of the blocks fast but Wigan steadied themselves well. Fine Maloney fk, McManaman impressive on the right. 
 A lot of tension inside the stadium here. A 1-1 draw not much good to either side, certainly not #wafc, which could play into #afc's hands. 
#afc 2-1 #wafc Walcott scrambles the ball home from close range
#afc 3-1 #wafc Poor Wigan defending and Podolski bursts through to lift the ball over Robles. Looks like the end for Wigan.
#afc 4-1 #wafc They are down now. Ramsey runs down the left and lifts his shot high into the net from a tight angle.
 FT 4-1 #afc Arsenal head to Newcastle on Sunday knowing CL football is in their hands. Cazorla, Walcott, Podolski all good. Wigan relegated. 
Crowd here singing 'There's only one Arsene Wenger' as the team complete a lap of appreciation. #afc
 Wenger:   Its all open (CL) but it depends on our result. Even third place is not out of sight.   #afc 
 Wenger:   Arteta pulled his calf so that could be a problem. He is a massive doubt for Sunday.   #afc

 Wenger:   The chance is still very small (for Arteta to be fit for Newcastle). I have a few options. I have not made a decision yet.   #afc 
 Wenger on Rooney:   At the moment we have no interest in anybody. We only have one interest, which is Sunday's game.   #afc 
 Wenger:   No matter what happens on Sunday, I will keep this team with a fantastic memory.   #afc 
 Wenger on Rooney:   I don't know if Man Utd would sell him. The first thing we would do is to call Man United, which we have not done.   #afc 
 Wenger confirms #afc in   advanced   talks to sign Yaya Sanogo from Auxerre. Says its not done yet but   very confident   it will be. 
At St James' Park for #nufc v #afc. Team news to follow shortly. Hearing Arteta has made the trip but would be very surprised if he plays.
Arteta starts for Arsenal. Very surprising. #afc
 #afc: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Ramsey; Walcott, Rosicky, Cazorla; Podolski. Giroud, Wilshere on bench. 
#afc beware: #nufc haven't scored in their last 2 home games. Last time they went three in a row without scoring was August 2007.
Watched Arteta pretty closely in the warm up. Looked to be moving freely enough but remains to be seen if he can last 90 minutes. #afc
Even contest here. #nufc look marginally more threatening. #afc composed enough but Wenger might want a little more urgency.
HT 0-0. Subdued #afc display. Priority of not going behind than taking the initiative. Arteta gamble backfired. #nufc sporadically dangerous
#nufc 0-1 #afc Koscielny hooks the ball home from close range.
 #nufc responded reasonably well to going behind, fuelled by belief they aren't getting much from ref Webb. But #afc holding firm for now. 
 @hirstclass Er, they haven't scored. Its still 1-0 Arsenal. 
 Podolski off, Giroud on for #afc. They have 13 minutes plus stoppages to see this out. 
Wilshere coming on for Cazorla. 88 mins played. #afc
Cleared. Nervous times on the Arsenal bench. #afc back in possession.
Full time. 1-0 #afc
#nufc 0-1 #afc Match report via @standardsport: ://bit.ly/13EliW4 
#nufc were bereft of intensity but thought #afc defended really well today. Koscielny & Mertesacker undoubtedly club's best CB pairing.
 @AKnight93 As it stands, yes, think he will. Arsenal have scouted centre-backs though- if they sign another one, that might change things.

 #afc refusing to up bid for Suarez, believing any Premier League ruling will be in their favour. Via @standardsport: ://bit.ly/15NkOND  
Not saying Suarez won't end up at #afc but thought it significant he didn't mention them by name. Think he'd welcome Real Madrid interest.
 What I mean is, Suarez's motivation for #afc move is CL football, not that its Arsenal specifically. A lot of other clubs could offer that. 
@larsso30 Then why not say 'I want to go to Arsenal'? Maybe I'm reading too much into it. Just an opinion.
@spearmanone @sdrewfootball My understanding is they were invited to bid at that level to trigger a clause. Don't think #afc expected this.
@11cannons @darktheory Very true. #afc's consistency in qualifying is impressive.
 Hodgson due to speak at 1pm so we'll find out more then. But for what its worth, #afc expect Wilshere to train at their Members' Day today.

 Wenger on the market:   Less than 2 weeks is a long time and 75 per cent of things happen in the last ten days.   #afc 
 Wenger on Oxlade-Chamberlain:   He will be out for at least six weeks. We don't think he will need surgery.   #afc

First column of the season: how #afc have gone about this transfer window all wrong. Via @standardsport:://bit.ly/1f2qBB9 
 #afc team v Fenerbahce: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Ramsey, Wilshere; Walcott, Rosicky, Cazorla; Giroud. 
 HT 0-0. Decent job from #afc so far, restricting Fenerbahce to very little. Need more in the final third to grab that vital away goal. 
 #Fenerbahce 0-1 #afc. Walcott gets in behind the back four and squares it to Gibbs, who stabs it home. 
 #Fenerbahce 0-2 #afc Ramsey shoots from 20 yards and beats Demirel, too easily it has to be said. Huge result this could be for Arsenal tho. 
Penalty to Arsenal.
#Fenerbahce 0-3 #afc Giroud tucks home the spot-kick after Kadlec fouled Walcott. Tie surely over.
 FT 0-3 #afc Big result for Arsenal. CL almost certain, will help in acquiring players. Fenerbahce poor but very mature and composed display. 
 Wenger confirms #afc pursuit of Luis Suarez is over.   Yes. Absolutely no chance of that,   he said.

 Asked if #afc have bid for Benzema/Di Maria:   I don't want to speak about names. I leave that to you and you do it very well.   
Wenger coy but think Flamini resigning for Arsenal will happen. Makes sense given lack of DM cover. Not the game-changing signing mooted tho
 Wenger on transfers, Flamini and Suarez. Via @standardsport: ://bit.ly/19Oprfw  #afc 
 At Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Jenkinson, Sagna, Mertesacker, Monreal; Ramsey, Wilshere; Walcott, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud. 
 #afc 1-0 #Fenerbahce If the tie wasn't over already, it is now. Walcott is tackled in the box but the loose ball falls to Ramsey, who scores 
 HT 1-0 #afc Arsenal in total control of the tie. Ramsey excellent, Szczesny inconsistent, Fenerbahce mostly awful. 
#afc 2-0 #Fenerbahce Lovely cushioned finish by Ramsey from Gibbs' cross.
FT 2-0 #afc (5-0 on agg). Ramsey excellent in easy win. Podolski & Ramsey injury worries for Wenger. Time to focus on transfers...
 Wenger:   We paid a heavy price because we lost Podolski. I don't know how bad Ramsey is or how Wilshere responds to an ankle problem.   #afc 
 Wenger:   Podolski is out for 21 days. Ramsey, we have to check how serious his groin is tomorrow.   #afc 
 As suggested already, Flamini has agreed terms on a three-year deal and will re-sign for Arsenal. Expected to be announced soon. #afc 
 Arsenal have enquired about Juventus' Fabio Quagliarella. No offer made yet. Meanwhile, Podolski out for 8-10 weeks with a hamstring injury. 
 CL draw: Group F: Arsenal, Marseille, Dortmund, Napoli. 
 Wenger:   I know all the players Tottenham bought. For the rest, we will see how they integrate.   #afc 
 Wenger:   We will not panic buy, you can believe me. It is not my strength to panic.   #afc 
 Q What do you think about Real Madrid paying £86m for Gareth Bale? Wenger:   They are very generous.   #afc 
 Wenger on Bendtner:   The chance for him to leave now is very small. If he comes back well and gets fit, I will use him.   #afc 
Am sure #afc will try to shift Bendtner by Monday & sign a striker but incredible to think he could become the club's fall-back option.
 At Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Ramsey, Wilshere; Walcott, Rosicky, Cazorla; Giroud. 
#afc 1-0 #thfc Walcott crosses and Giroud converts smartly at the near post.
 HT 1-0 #afc Gunners more inventive in possession so far. Walcott, Cazorla threatening. #thfc far too laboured in midfield, Soldado isolated. 
Defoe on for Dembele with 20 minutes left here. Better from #thfc but #afc dangerous on the break. 1-0.
 Now Monreal for Rosicky. Monreal goes to left wing, Cazorla central. #afc 
FT 1-0 #afc Frantic at the end but Arsenal hang on. #thfc lacked any real incision for all their 2nd half possession.
 Wenger:   I am one of the few who never doubted [the spirit of this team].   #afc 
 Wenger on Flamini:   I said it was a no-brainer. I am just sorry he didn't cost £25m.   #afc 
 Wenger:   We have 24 more hours and maybe we can surprise you, maybe not.   #afc 
 Wenger on Wilshere:   He has a stomach bug but nothing to stop him joining up with England.   #afc 
 With Real open to offers, the biggest problem #afc have is convincing Ozil to join. Not saying it won't happen but not a foregone conclusion 
#afc expect to sign Palermo goalkeeper Emiliano Viviano today. Not signing as automatic 1st choice - Wenger keen to persist with Szczesny.
Ozil deal to Arsenal very close but not quite done. He's undergoing his medical in Germany right now. #afc

Irony alert: Marseille coach Ellie Baup is fending off questions about how #OM can compete with #afc “spending 50m euros on one player”.
 Wenger:   If you look at the group, I would say yes it is the hardest because all four teams have a chance to qualify.   #afc

Arteta on the bench for Arsenal. As is Bendtner. Would be interested to see what reception he gets today should he be required.
Late change to the #afc line-up. Walcott out through illness and Serge Gnabry makes his first PL start.
 Update on Walcott - not an illness, #afc confirm a   minor pelvic/abdominal problem   he has been carrying all week. Felt it in the warmup. 
#afc 1-0 #Stoke. Ozil's free-kick parried by Begovic and Ramsey turns home the rebound. Seventh Arsenal goal of the season for him.
 #afc 1-1 #Stoke Mertesacker loses Arnautovic and his shot hits the post, falling to Geoff Cameron to equalise for Stoke. 
#afc 2-1 #Stoke Mertesacker turns home Ozil's corner and Arsenal are back in front.
 HT 2-1 #afc Decent game. Ozil making Arsenal tick, Gnabry keeping things simple. Stoke trying to play but undone so far by poor goalkeeping. 
#afc 3-1 #Stoke. Ozil's free-kick is headed home superbly by Sagna. Wonderful looping effort.
FT 3-1 #afc. Arsenal top of the league for now as Stoke enjoy some good possession but concede 3 from set-pieces. Weird. Ozil good.

 #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Flamini; Rosicky, Ozil, Ramsey; Giroud. Wilshere on the bench. 
 #afc 1-0 Napoli. Superb goal. Giroud flicks the ball on for Ramsey and his cross finds Ozil, whose measured sidefoot finish beats Reina. 
 #afc 2-0 Napoli. Ozil makes a darting run into the box and picks out Giroud, who stabs it home. Arsenal rampant. 
HT 2-0 #afc superb in the first 25 mins - probably the best they've played this season. Napoli v slow start (bit like Milan here in 11/12).
 FT 2-0 #afc killed this with a superb start & maintained their focus thereafter. Ozil, Ramsey, Giroud, Flamini all very good. Napoli poor.

#wbafc 1-0 #afc Amalfitano's cross is headed in at the near post by Yacob. His first goal for the club.
HT 1-0 #wbafc Tight game but #afc's vulnerability on their left has cost them. Wilshere struggling. Test of Arsenal's resolve now.
#afc out early for the second half here. No changes at half-time. 1-0 #wbafc
 Ramsey off, Rosicky on here. Surprised Wilshere is staying on, especially given Ramsey's form recently. #afc 
 What do I know? (Don't answer that) #wbafc 1-1 #afc Wilshere smashes home an equaliser, deflected off Olsson. 
FT 1-1 Improved 2nd half showing from #afc but Anelka will rue missed chances just after the break. Thought Rosicky did well when coming on.
 Wilshere admits his smoking   mistake   to Arsenal Player: “I made a mistake. Players make mistakes. I am not a smoker.   #AFC

 #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Ramsey; Wilshere, Ozil, Rosicky; Giroud. Cazorla on the bench. 
#afc 0-1 #Dortmund Ramsey loses possession cheaply and Lewandowski feeds Mkhitaryan who beats Szczesny. Reward for a fine start.
#afc 1-1 #Dortmund Subotic gets something on Sagna's cross prompting Weidenfeller to fumble and Giroud smashes home the equaliser.
 HT 1-1 #Dortmund have been impressive, their high line and pressing game disrupting #afc's rhythm. Arsenal a little lucky but Giroud good. 
@SimeonLow Arsenal certainly better as the half wore on but thought Dortmund played with a little more assurance.
#afc 1-2 #Dortmund They've been under the cosh but suddenly a counter-attack finds Lewandowski at the back post and he beats Szczesny.
FT 1-2 #Dortmund Arsenal unfortunate to lose after a good 2nd half display. Lewandowski elbowed Koscielny but stayed on to net the winner.
 Wenger:   It looked like that [Lewandowski should have been sent off]. The referee was in a much better situation that I was.   #afc 
 Ignore earlier tweet about Group F table. Arsenal top, Dortmund second, Napoli third, say UEFA. My mistake. Still, all on 6 pts & very tight

 Mourinho on #afc game:   If they want #afc to win a trophy, that's a help. If they want a big game in London, they should play it on Weds.   
 At Emirates. #afc team: Fabianski, Jenkinson, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Monreal; Ramsey, Wilshere; Miyaichi, Rosicky, Cazorla; Bendtner. 
 #afc 0-1 #cfc Bad error from Jenkinson allows Azpilicueta to complete a Chelsea breakaway, poking the ball past Fabianski. 
Olivier Giroud is looking a better player by the minute here. Nothing sticking to Bendtner at all - #afc can't get into the game.
 HT 0-1 #cfc Blues look sharper and better organised. #afc struggling for cohesion, Bendtner poor, too many individual errors eg the goal. 
Ryo Miyiachi - who looked lost for long periods - is replaced by Mesut Ozil. Some intent there from Wenger. 64 mins gone 0-1 #afc
#afc 0-2 #cfc Willian wins a header and the ball falls to Mata who smashes it right-footed past Fabianski.
De Bruyne off and Ramires on for #cfc. Away fans chant Mourinho's name. Chelsea have looked pretty comfortable so far. Arsenal very flat.
 Chelsea sub: Ba on for Eto'o. Arsenal sub: Ramsey off, Ju Young Park on. That about sums up the difference between these two tonight. 
 Wenger on Mourinho maintaining his record against Arsenal:   I don't think he scored the first goal.   #afc

 Arteta also struggling with bug going around #afc camp but he starts. Gnabry also had it, he's on the bench. 
#mufc 1-0 #afc Rooney swings over a corner and Van Persie climbs highest to head home.
HT 1-0 #mufc Even contest. Vidic touch-tight marking of Giroud means #afc can't get ball into him and play off him. Ozil quiet as a result.
@PeteBryant30 Not at all. Just saying #afc haven't been able to get into the game as an attacking force using a method they often employ.
 Given that, boost for #afc that Vidic has had to go off at HT. Cleverley on for #mufc. Back underway. 
 Wilshere on, Flamini off for #afc. Giroud in the game a bit more. Wenger needed to gamble - ruing he doesn't have a CF other than Bendtner? 
 Kagawa off, Giggs on for #mufc. Cazorla off, Bendtner on for #afc. Wenger hasn't read his Danish interview then...

Penalty to Arsenal
Tame penalty from Ozil after Ramsey was fouled - Mandanda saves to his right. Stays 1-0 #afc
 HT 1-0 #afc Home side far superior - should be further ahead. Ramsey, Wilshere good. Ozil a little subdued - bad penalty miss. 
#OM double change to sharpen #afc minds. Valbuena and Thauvin on - both are threats. Still 1-0 #afc 59 mins played.
#afc 2-0 #OM Incisive move from Arsenal culminates in Ozil finding Wilshere for a tap-in.
FT 2-0 #afc Job done tonight. Group F still alive despite being on 12 points due to Dortmund's victory but Arsenal in pole position.
 Wenger:   We were never really under threat tonight. We had a good control and maybe missed the cutting edge to finish it off.   #afc

I seem to be in a minority here but surprised Flamini isn't starting for #afc. Not as baffling as Mourinho's treatment of Cole though. #cfc
 #cfc look to be 4-3-3 here. Willian wide right, Hazard left. #afc usual shape. 
HT 0-0 #cfc's contain and counter policy working well. Mikel lucky not to see red though. #afc lacking rhythm & look vulnerable on the break
#cfc have brought on Schurrle and now Oscar. Wenger yet to act - is he really happy with how #afc are playing? 0-0 79 mins gone.
 FT 0-0. In a word: dull. #cfc came for a draw, #afc failed to do enough to break them down. Mourinho's tactics spot on in that respect. 
 Mourinho on #afc complaints over Mikel tackle and pen claim:   They like to cry. That's tradition and I was saying that to the 4th official.

 #SaintsFC 1-0 #afc Fonte heads home Shaw's cross, beating Szczesny at his near post. 
 HT 1-0 #SaintsFC should be further ahead. #afc terrible, lacking any dynamism in midfield. But, Boruc needed to keep out Koscielny effort.

 #SaintsFC 2-2 #afc Bonkers game. Rodriquez makes inroads into the box and pulls it back for Lallana, who sweeps it home.

 At Colney.   Wenger: Flamini is out of course [suspended]. Rosicky is back in the squad, joining full training today.   #afc 
 Wenger:   We are open-minded and active. We look at the opportunities. We still try to bring at least one body in.   #afc 
 Wenger:   A midfielder? It is one of the situations we look at it, yes.   #afc 
Ramsey out of the Bayern game. Wenger says he is out for at least a month. Describes it as a big setback. #afc
 Wenger:   We are short and I am confident we will bring someone in today. It is 80-20 (likely).   #afc 
Wenger says #afc want to sign a midfielder more than a striker today and claims Draxler will stay at Schalke in this window.
Looks like Kallstrom to Arsenal will happen. He's going to have a medical this afternoon. #afc
 #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Arteta, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Cazorla, Ozil, Podolski; Giroud 
 HT 0-0 Pulis' tactics working well here as #afc stifled, lacking width. #cpfc defending resolutely, away fans in excellent voice. 
#afc 1-0 #cpfc Oxlade-Chamberlain lifts the ball over Speroni just after the restart.
Pulis responds by bringing on Bannan for Jerome. Chamakh goes to centre-forward. 1-0 #afc 57 mins gone.
 Podolski off, Rosicky on. #afc still 1-0 up but a little nervy with #cpfc very much in the game. 72 mins gone. 
Not anymore. #afc 2-0 #cpfc Oxlade-Chamberlain finished a fine run into the box right-footed from 16 yards.
Asked Wenger last month about Ox playing CM one day soon. He said he was ready now. Tougher opponents to come but this a fine audition. #afc

FA Cup clearly best chance of silverware for #afc yet 7 changes reflects Wenger's belief that PL/CL success is possible. Am not surprised.
#afc or #lfc will play Everton in the next round. What a ludicrously timed FA Cup draw.
Rare to see Wenger pacing the technical area this early in a game. Nervy start from Arsenal.
 #afc 1-0 #lfc Ozil floats a ball in, Sanogo has a shot blocked and Oxlade-Chamberlain turns home the rebound.

Penalty to Arsenal.
The pace of this game has slowed after a breathless start ended with Ozil's penalty miss. #afc still matching Bayern stride for stride.
Gibbs coming off here holding his left hamstring. Monreal on. #afc
 HT. 0-0, although not sure how. #afc started well but Bayern gradually asserting their authority. UEFA surely will look at Szczesny gesture. 
#afc 0-1 #Bayern Kroos hits a fine shot into the top corner from Lahm's pass. No stopping that.
Bayern monopolising the ball. Difficult situation for Arsenal. Instinct must be to attack but you feel a 2nd Bayern goal would kill the tie.
#afc 0-2 #Bayern What a killer goal that could be. Lahm is allowed to drift infield and float a cross that Mueller heads past Fabianski.
 FT 0-2 #Bayern An injury, red card and missed pen too much for #afc to overcome. Bayern utterly dominant 11 v 10. Miracle needed in Munich. 
 Wenger:   [The tie] is not over. We will fight until the end.   #afc 
 #afc confirm new   long-term   deals for Rosicky and Mertesacker. Understood to be until 2016 for Rosicky and until 2017 for Mertesacker.

#efc 3-0 #afc Awful defending. Naismith's attempt to convert Mirallas's pass is saved by Szczesny. But Mirallas bundles home the rebound.

Quite rare to see Wenger pacing around his technical area like this early on. #afc in total control of the ball but Wigan happy to sit deep.

 Huge boos from the #afc fans as Wenger takes off Podolski for Giroud. Sanogo stays on. 22 mins left, 1-0 #wafc. 
#wafc 1-1 #afc A small period of sustained pressure tells as Mertesacker heads the ball home from close range.
1-1 End of 90 minutes. #afc scramble their way into extra time.
 HT in ET and still 1-1. Looks destined for penalties here - #afc out of ideas, #wafc almost out on their feet. 
Ramsey surely exhausted and replaced by Kallstrom. Sensible decision to take him off but #afc surely lose a penalty taker there.
 #afc win 4-2 on penalties after Arteta, Kallstrom, Giroud and Cazorla score & Fabianski saves twice. #afc through to the final.

 At Carrow Road. #afc team: Fabianski, Jenkinson, Sagna, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Ramsey; Rosicky, Ozil, Podolski; Giroud. 
Very little happening at Norwich. Redmond cut in from the left & forced a decent stop from Fabianski. That's it. Arsenal offering nothing.
Sartorial update: Wenger is not wearing his puffer jacket but has an Arsenal blanket draped over his legs in the dugout. Go figure.
#afc starting to fire in the final third now. Podolski forces Ruddy into a save he betters moments later when Giroud is clean through.
 HT 0-0 Three excellent stops from Ruddy has kept this goalless. Game understandably lacking intensity but after quiet start, #afc on top.

Diaby (and Sanogo) comes on here. His first Arsenal appearance since 16 March 2013 (v Swansea).

 Podolski off, Sanogo on. Wenger goes with two up front. Arsenal haven't created much so far from open play. 62 mins gone, 1-2 #hcafc 
#afc 2-2 #hcafc The pressure had been building. Koscielny turns it home from close range.
End of 90 mins. 2-2. #afc pressure told & have had pen shouts but not creating enough. #hcafc dogged but threat reduced to set-pieces.
#afc 3-2 #hcafc Ramsey finishes well after smart work from Sanogo and then Giroud.
 FT 3-2 #afc Fraught, to say the least, but Arsenal finally win their first trophy since 2005. Great final, #hcafc played their part. 
 Sagna to BBC on his #afc future:   I don't know...I've been talking with the club for a long time and we'll try to find a solution.   
 Wenger:   ... It was never a question of leaving, it was a question of doing the right job for this club.   #afc

 Hodgson on Ox (2):   The #eng medical team is in direct dialogue with their #afc counterparts and we obviously are all hoping for the best.” 
Fabregas a good fit for #cfc. Think it places more pressure on Wenger & #afc to be pro-active in the market having opted not to re-sign him.

 At Wembley. #afc team: Szczesny, Debuchy, Chambers, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta, Wilshere; Ramsey, Alexis, Cazorla; Sanogo. 
 #afc 1-0 #mcfc Wilshere is fouled on the edge of the box but the loose ball falls to Cazorla, who beats Caballero. 
#afc 2-0 #mcfc A breakaway sees Sanogo smuggle the ball forward to Ramsey and he finishes emphatically.
HT 2-0 #afc seem to be thriving from relatively serene pre-season compared to past years. #mcfc missing players but surprisingly poor.
 #afc 3-0 #mcfc Giroud, on for Sanogo, smashes a superb dipping left-foot shot past Caballero from 25 yards. Surely game over. 
 FT 3-0 #afc. City abject but impressive from Arsenal, whose pre-season ends with an encouraging win. And a (sort of) trophy.

 #afc 1-0 #Besiktas Right on the stroke of half-time, Sanchez converts a loose ball after Wilshere miscontrolled Ozil's pass. 
Debuchy sent off here. An tense crowd just got a whole lot more concerned. #afc 1-0 up but 15 minutes left. CL qualification in the balance.
FT 1-0 #afc. Big fist-clenched celebration from Wenger greets the final whistle. Huge tension but 17th season in the CL confirmed.

Can't see #afc paying £55m for Falcao. At odds with their financial plan. Loan not impossible but focus so far on CBs. Nastasic enquiry made
Danny Welbeck is at #afc's training ground. He would prefer joining #afc over #thfc & is trying to force through a deal. Wenger's move now.
There's a fair chance the Welbeck deal will be completed in time. #afc and #mufc finalising fee of about £17m.
“@TomCStandard: kudos to colleague @JamesOlley who had story first of Welbeck back at Arsenal to force through move.” Thanks fellas.
 At Colney. Wenger:   We assess Ramsey today - he has a little chance to be available for Saturday. He has a minor ankle problem.   #afc 
 Wenger says because he went to Rome, he was up at 6am and available all day.   I will tell you the story one day.   #afc 
@RemyCee @AST_arsenal @N1_Angel Kind of you to say- thanks. The Scottish question certainly threw me!
 At Signal Iduna Park. #afc team: Szczesny, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Arteta; Sanchez, Ramsey, Wilshere, Ozil; Welbeck. 
#bvb 1-0 #afc Awful from a defensive point of view. An aimless ball forward finds Immobile and he runs the length of #afc's half & scores.
HT 1-0 #bvb It had been coming. Credit Immobile for keeping his composure & finishing well but #afc far too easily undone.
#bvb 2-0 #afc Aubameyang finishes after Szczesny comes out to collect Grosskreutz's through ball and gets caught in no mans land.
Feels like another evening when #afc's full-backs are being asked to play too high up the pitch. It also exacerbates Arteta's lack of pace.
FT 2-0 #bvb Arsenal utterly outplayed with deficiencies that should have been addressed in the summer brutally exposed. Plenty to work on.

#afc 2-0 #Galatasaray Great pace & composure from Welbeck as he breaks clear to double Arsenal's lead.
#afc 3-0 #Galatasaray Sanchez gets in on the act. Arsenal's pace far too much for the Turkish side to handle. Good Ozil pass.
HT 3-0 #afc Dreadful defending from Galatasaray but Arsenal vibrant in attack & deserve their lead. Welbeck goals well taken.
#afc 4-0 #Galatasaray Welbeck hat-trick. Oxlade-Chamberlain finds Welbeck at the end of a flowing move and he finishes deftly.
 #afc 4-1 #Galatasaray Ospina's first act is to pick the ball out of the net as Burak Yilmaz, who was fouled by Szczesny, slots home.

 #afc more compact in midfield so far. Significantly, full-backs aren't bombing forward from the outset so #cfc having to work to find space. 
 #cfc 1-0 #afc Hazard, clearly fouled by Koscielny, steps up to stroke the ball past Szczesny. 
 #cfc 1-0 #afc Rarely seen Wenger so irate at everything and everyone. #cfc edging midfield battle, hope Courtois is OK after worrying injury 
 Cazorla off, Ox on for #afc, Mikel on, Schurrle off for #cfc. Mourinho beating his chest at Diego Costa, demanding more fight. 
#cfc 2-0 #afc Fabregas lifts a fine ball over the Arsenal defence and Costa finishes superbly.
FT 2-0 #cfc Change in approach for #afc but familiar outcome with Chelsea superior & able to conjure two moments of outstanding class.
 Mourinho:   #afc gave us a difficult game but we dealt with it without problems. We were ready for them to have the ball as they like it.

A third of this game gone and #afc only need 3 more if Dortmund draw to top the group. Galatasaray are so bad that 3 more looks manageable.
 HT 0-3 #afc So, so easy but Arsenal have done the job well. Dortmund drawing 0-0. Six goals well within reach if they go for it.

 #afc team: Szczesny, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Chambers, Gibbs, Flamini, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Cazorla, Sanchez, Giroud, Welbeck. 
Watch it end up 0-0 now but hard not to see there being a few goals in this. #lfc v #afc
 Debuchy at centre-half again, presumably to try and combat Sterling's pace through the middle. #afc 
#lfc the better side early on here but #afc will probably be happy enough. They were 4-0 down by this point in February.
#lfc 1-0 #afc Coutinho scores on the stroke of half-time with a low drive in off the post.
#lfc 1-2 #afc Stunning move. Giroud plays a one-two with Cazorla and fires Arsenal in front. Against the run of play but a fine goal.
#lfc 2-2 #afc Skrtel powers home a stoppage time header to equalise.

At Emirates. Walcott and Campbell start for #afc. Full team shortly.
 #afc team: Ospina, Bellerin, Chambers, Mertesacker, Monreal, Coquelin, Rosicky, Cazorla, Walcott, Campbell, Sanchez. 
 #afc 1-0 #Hull Mertesacker heads home from a corner, easy as you like. 
 HT 1-0 #afc 15 changes between the two sides and it shows. Disjointed game at times but, that said, #afc more assured and deservedly lead. 
#afc 2=0 #hcfc That's that. Sanchez turns and finishes from the edge of the box. He's been the best player on the pitch. Again.
 FT 2-0 #afc Wenger could barely have wished for an easier ride. #hcfc put up minimal resistance, #afc did the job comfortably.

At Emirates. Szczesny left out of #afc starting line up.
 #afc team: Ospina, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal, Rosicky, Coquelin, Cazorla, Ox, Giroud,
Sanchez. 
 #afc 1-0 #scfc Arsenal have made a fast start and it pays off. Sanchez swings in a cross and Koscielny, totally unmarked, heads home. 
#afc 2-0 #scfc Brilliant from Sanchez again. Rides a robust tackle from Nzonzi to play a one-two with Rosicky and finishes at the near post.
HT 2-0 #afc Sanchez superb again. #scfc roughing #afc up but home side have still found their rhythm. Debuchy having shoulder X-ray.
#afc 3-0 #scfc Sanchez free-kick finds its way through the wall and Begovic fumbles it into the net via the post.
FT 3-0 #afc Good win with Sanchez the catalyst once again. Dealt much better with Stoke's physicality this time. Injury situation easing too
What next for Ospina and Szczesny? Some thoughts on #afc 3-0 #scfc: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wengers-no1-issue-ahead-of-manchester-city-v-arsenal-9972213.html …

#afc agree fee in region of £2.5m with Legia for Bielik. Personal terms to be discussed. Story here: ://bit.ly/BielikFeeAgreed 
 Wenger reiterates Arsenal are in the transfer market for a defender.   We are looking more for the defensive department.   
A preview of #mcfc v #afc and how Arsenal must break the cycle of failure against fellow top four teams: ://bit.ly/Arsenalstep 
 @HowardBryant I am CFC at the Standard but before that I was Arsenal Corr and due to small staff, I still mostly have to do both roles. 
 At the Etihad. #afc team: Ospina, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal, Coquelin, Ramsey, Ox-Chambo, Cazorla, Sanchez, Giroud. 
Penalty to Arsenal.
#mcfc 0-1 #afc Cazorla converts after Kompany was adjudged to have brought down Monreal.
HT 0-1 #afc Hardly recognise this version of Arsenal in a big game. Resilient & well organised. Pen looked soft though. City missing Toure.
#mcfc 0-2 #afc Giroud heads home Cazorla's free-kick;. Simple as you like.
#mcfc 0-2 #afc The seeds of this display were sown against Stoke but to flower against Man City like this is unexpected and impressive.

@jorianm Not sure what the argument is here. I don't praise Arsenal enough because the Russians tell me not to?
 Wenger on Arsenal trying to sign Paulista:   The talks are progressing quite well. Can we find an agreement or not? I don't know.   
 Wenger says there is a  50-50 chance   of Arsenal signing Paulista. 
 Also, new deal on the table for Coquelin, perhaps not for Diaby, #afc team news and Brighton's threat: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-praises-hugely-improved-francis-coquelin-and-confirms-midfielder-has-been-offered-new-contract-9994800.html … 
 At the Amex Stadium. #afc team: Szczesny, Chambers, Koscielny, Monreal, Gibbs, Flamini, Walcott, Ramsey, Ozil, Rosicky, Giroud. 
#bhafc 0-1 #afc Smart control and finish from Walcott gives Arsenal the perfect start.
 #afc fans singing:   Wojciech Szczesny, he smokes when he wants.   
 #bhafc 0-2 #afc Another slick passing move, this time finished by Ozil. 
 HT 0-2 #afc Easy, really. #bhafc have stood off #afc & paid the price. Arsenal's interchanging of positions in midfield fascinating to watch 
 #bhafc 1-2 #afc Almost out of nothing, O'Grady rolls Flamini and fires past Szczesny. 
#bhafc 1-3 #afc Great volley from Rosicky settles a few nerves in the away end.
#bhafc 2-3 #afc Just when you thought it was over...Baldock races through and dinks the ball over Szczesny.
FT 2-3 #afc Second half was more testing for Arsenal than it should have been but credit Brighton for rallying admirably.
 Gabriel Paulista having a medical in London today ahead of move to Arsenal. Assuming no hitches, deal should be done by tonight.

 At Emirates. #afc team: Ospina, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal, Coquelin, Ramsey, Walcott, Cazorla, Ozil, Giroud. 
#afc 1-0 #avfc Giroud races clear and dinks the ball over Guzan.
This already looks very ominous for Villa. Arsenal could be a couple up at least by now.
 HT 1-0 #afc Arsenal should be further ahead but Villa are staying competitive. Coquelin very solid in midfield, Walcott rusty. 
#afc 2-0 #avfc Giroud releases Ozil and he finishes left-footed past Guzan.
#afc 3-0 #avfc Now Walcott gets in on the act. He plays a one-two with Cazorla and finishes inside the far post.
Penalty to Arsenal
#afc 4-0 #avfc Guzan can only palm it into the net. Cazorla laughs as he celebrates.
 FT 5-0 #afc Arsenal's biggest win of the season. Ozil, Coquelin, Cazorla, Giroud all very good. Big morale boost. 5 straight wins. 
Wary of saying this given how quickly things can change on deadline day but don't expect any further Arsenal business as things stand.
Ozil takes first step out of Sanchez's shadow. Thoughts on #afc 5-0 #avfc:://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/no-alexis-sanchez-no-problem-for-arsenal-as-mesut-ozil-takes-the-spotlight-10017932.html …

 At Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Chambers, Gabriel, Koscielny, Gibbs, Flamini, Cazorla, Welbeck, Ozil, Sanchez, Giroud. 
 #afc 1-0 #Boro Really well worked goal. Cazorla slips a ball out to Gibbs, who crosses for Giroud to turn the ball home from close range. 
 #afc 2-0 #Boro Sanchez's corner is turned home first time at the near post by Giroud. Terrible marking, fine finish. 
 HT 2-0 #afc Excellent half from Arsenal, starting with intent and never letting up. Two fine finishes from Giroud. #Boro penned in. 
 FT 2-0 #afc Job done impressively by Arsenal. Giroud, Cazorla & Gibbs particularly good I thought but a positive day for #afc all round.

 At Emirates. #afc team: Ospina, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs; Coquelin; Sanchez, Ozil, Cazorla, Welbeck; Giroud. 
#afc had scored in the first 30 minutes of their previous nine games. But not tonight. Monaco well organised. Clear chances in short supply.
#afc 0-1 #Monaco Kondogbia smashes a shot from 25 yards that deflects off Mertesacker and past Ospina.
HT 0-1 #afc Difficult position now. Arsenal need to take risks but a second goal would be a killer. Time for Walcott?
#afc 0-2 #Monaco Sucker-punch of a counter attack finished by Berbatov. Mountain to climb now.
#afc 1-2 #Monaco Oxlade-Chamberlain curls the ball home from the edge of the box. Fine finish.
FT #afc 1-3 #Monaco Unbelievable. Wenger is furious. Ferreira-Carrasco finishes in off the post in the game's last meaningful act.
 Wenger says Arsenal's defending for the 2nd and 3rd goal was   suicidal  .   It looks like we lost our nerves and rationality on the pitch.

#qpr 0-1 #afc Giroud scores from close range.
#qpr 0-2 #afc Sanchez doubles Arsenal's lead.

Reading 0-1 #afc Sanchez finishes from close range.
HT 0-1 #afc Finely crafted goal at a key time for #afc. Reading could get hurt on the break but they will have to open up at some point.
Reading 1-1 #afc McCleary turns the ball over the line and the Championship side are level. Szczesny could have done better on first viewing
Reading 1-2 #afc What a mistake by Federici. He allows Sanchez's tame shot to squirm through his legs and over the line.

#afc 1-0 #avfc Walcott smashes the ball home left-footed. Deserved on the balance of play.
HT 1-0 #afc Wenger's gamble on Walcott paying off as #avfc haven't settled and Theo took his goal very well. #afc more assured than last yr.
#afc 2-0 #avfc Stunning long-range effort from Sanchez.
#afc 3-0 #avfc Mertesacker heads home Cazorla's corner. Easy as you like. Bad goal to concede from #avfc's point of view.

HT 1-0 #afc An even contest. Arsenal causing a variety of problems with their pace but Ramires missed a glorious chance to equalise.
No handshake between Mourinho and Wenger at full-time. #afc win 1-0. First win for AW in 14 attempts over Mourinho.
 Mourinho shakes the hand of every #afc player, ignores Wenger, walks down the tunnel and chucks his runners-up medal into the crowd.

#afc 0-1 #Olympiacos Arsenal caught out by a corner pulled to the edge of the box from which Pardo fires home.
This is Olympiacos' 13th visit to England. That is their fourth goal. They've conceded 37. Surely #afc will find a way back?
#afc 1-1 #Olympiacos Walcott equalises on cue. Very poor goalkeeping.
#afc 1-2 #Olympiacos Ospina appears to have dropped a corner into his own net. Is it over the line? Very hard to tell even on a replay.
HT 1-2 #Olympiacos. Well. #afc are making a complete and utter mess of this so far. Back-to-back games v Bayern coming up remember...
Pattern of this game is set now. #afc finally going through the gears and pushing Olympiacos back. 27 minutes to find a way back.

#afc 1-0 #mufc Ozil crosses and Sanchez coverts at the near post.
#afc 2-0 #mufc Ozil doubles the home side's lead. Fantastic start from Arsenal.
#afc 3-0 #mufc That is sublime. Sanchez works the ball onto his right foot and smashes it into the top corner.
Don't understand LVG's decision to omit Schneiderlin. United bypassed in midfield due to #afc's pace.
HT 3-0 #afc Stunning half from Arsenal. Sharper in every department and 3 excellent goals. #mufc no cutting edge to their possession.
FT 3-0 #afc  A team transformed from Tuesday night. Big win for Wenger. Must match this intensity in their work on and off the ball now.

 Amid the talk of #afc signing a striker and Giroud rotating with Walcott, Joel Campbell is a forgotten man: ://bit.ly/RareChance  
 At Hillsborough. #afc team: Cech, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Chambers, Gibbs; Flamini, Kamara; Campbell, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Iwobi; Giroud. 
Glen Kamara gets a chance tonight with Mikel Arteta injured. He also becomes the first player from Finland ever to represent Arsenal.
Walcott also having to go off injured here. Could be a very damaging night for Arsenal. Ismael Bennacer -a midfielder - is on for his debut.
 #swfc 1-0 #afc Very well worked goal puts the home side in front, scored by Ross Wallace. 
#swfc 2-0 #afc Superb cross swung into the box from the left and Joao steers a header past Cech.
 HT 2-0 #swfc Utterly deserved. Wednesday first to every ball & want it more. #afc abject in attack, idle in defence. Debuchy & Flamini bad. 
 #swfc 3-0 #afc A set-piece is worked to the back post, sidefooted across goal by Lees and turned in by Hutchinson. Bordering on humiliation. 
 Another Arsenal debutant, this time Krystian Bielik. Go on then, son, 30 minutes to salvage this on your first taste of English football... 
 FT 3-0 #swfc Resounding win for the better team throughout. Arsenal underestimated their opponents, not for the first time this season.

Koscielny not playing for #afc tonight.
 #afc: Cech, Debuchy, Mertesacker, Gabriel, Monreal; Cazorla, Coquelin; Campbell, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud.

Koscielny (hip) fit enough for the bench. But hard not to feel biggest problem for #afc could be Douglas Costa lining up against Debuchy...
#Bayern 1-0 #afc Thiago crosses for Lewandowski who heads past Cech. No replays here. Offside?
Twitter tells me it was onside (thanks to all). Arsenal think they've equalised but Ozil used his elbow to convert Monreal's cross.
 #Bayern 2-0 #afc Coman scuffs a shot but it falls to Muller, who converts from 12 yards out. 
#Bayern 3-0 #afc Alaba bends one into the top corner from 25 yards. Game well and truly over.
HT 3-0 #Bayern. One way traffic. Damage limitation for #afc now. Ref might even stop it before the end out of sympathy.
#Bayern 4-0 #afc Robben converts at the near post seconds after coming on.
 #afc fans in positive mood...   We're gonna win 5-4   they chant at the Allianz. 
 #Bayern 4-1 #afc Decent goal, that. Sanchez clips the ball into Giroud, who chests the ball and acrobatically volleys into the net. 
#Bayern 5-1 #afc Muller sidefoots the ball home to complete a slick Bayern move. Clever finish.
FT 5-1 #Bayern A rout. #afc's CL hopes hanging by a thread now. Think Wenger went straight down the tunnel without shaking Guardiola's hand.

#afc 0-1 #thfc Kane beats the offside trap and slots past Cech.
 HT 0-1 #thfc Spurs good value for their lead, looking comfortable. #afc lack intensity in their passing - fatigue from Wednesday perhaps. 
 @Paul_NewmanDM Of course but Arsenal travelled, intensity of the game higher at Bayern, plus only one change made. 
 Of course, Spurs played a day later but #afc had to travel, endured a game with much higher intensity v Bayern and have only made one change 
#afc 1-1 #thfc Gibbs forces the ball over the line from Ozil's cross.

#afc 1-0 #Dinamo Ozil breaks the deadlock with a diving header.
#afc 2-0 #Dinamo Sanchez turns home Monreal's cross and that should - should - be job done.
This utterly one-sided game only makes it all the more inexplicable that Arsenal managed to lose in Zagreb.
HT 2-0 #afc Completely dominant against a very limited team. A question of how many #afc want to score.
 #afc 3-0 #Dinamo Great ball from Campbell finds Sanchez, who rounds the keeper and does the rest. Take him off, Arsene. 
FT 3-0 #afc They've given themselves a chance. Morale-boosting win but its all on the trip to Greece now.

 At Olympiacos. #afc team: Cech, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Flamini, Ramsey; Walcott, Ozil, Campbell; Giroud. 
#afc more interested in staying in the game than trying to win it for the time being. Wenger wanted patience. He's certainly got that.
Olympiacos 0-1 #afc Giroud heads home. Poor goalkeeping. Game on...
HT 0-1 #afc Halfway there. Wenger stalking the technical area loaded with nervous energy but #afc are doing OK here. Crowd subdued.
Olympiacos 0-2 #afc Giroud is on hand to sidefoot home.

 At Villa Park. #afc team: Cech, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Flamini, Ramsey; Walcott, Ozil, Campbell; Giroud. 
Penalty to Arsenal
#avfc 0-1 #afc Giroud converts the spot kick. Shame for Villa as they had made a bright start.
 #afc fans in gleeful mood here.   You're going down with the Chelsea.   No response from Villa fans. 
 #avfc 0-2 #afc Wonderful counter-attacking goal. Ramsey tackle, Walcott pass, Ozil assist, Ramsey finish. 
 HT 0-2 #afc Very, very comfortable for Arsenal. Villa desperately short on quality and confidence. Hard to see a way back from here. 
   Jack Grealish, he drinks when he wants   sing the #afc fans. 
FT 0-2 #afc Better from Villa after the break but #afc always comfortable. Ozil excellent (again). #afc top of the table.

 At Emirates. #afc team as in Standard: Cech, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Ramsey, Flamini; Walcott, Ozil, Campbell; Giroud. 
Looks like #afc have watched the video of January's 2-0 win at City. Sitting back like they did then. #mcfc edging it as a result so far.
 #afc 1-0 #mcfc Wonderful strike from Walcott, cutting in on his right foot and burying a fine effort past Hart. 
#afc 2-0 #mcfc Terrible pass from Mangala. Ozil assist (of course) as Giroud fires through Hart and into the net.
HT 2-0 #afc Contain and counter working a treat for Arsenal so far but #mcfc still carry a threat. Interested to see how long Aguero lasts.
 #afc 2-1 #mcfc Sagna squares the ball to Yaya Toure, who sidefoots brilliantly into the top corner from the edge of the box. 
FT 2-1 #afc Frantic finale but a big win for Arsenal. Now established as Leicester's main challengers over the festive period (at least).

 At Anfield. #afc: Cech, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Flamini, Ramsey; Campbell, Ozil, Walcott; Giroud. 
 #lfc 1-0 #afc Walcott tries to run it out of defence. Bad idea. Can shoots, Cech saves but Firmino turns home the rebound. 
 #lfc 1-1 #afc Out of nothing, Arsenal are level. Great play from Campbell, delightful pass for Ramsey who beats Mignolet at his near post. 
#lfc 2-1 #afc Fabulous strike from Firmino. Bent into the top corner from 25 yards.
lfc 2-2 #afc This game is bonkers. Liverpool fail to defend a corner properly and it finds its way into the net. Hard to see who got a touch
#lfc 2-3 #afc Fabulous turn and strike from Giroud.
 #lfc 3-3 #afc Last season there was a 97th minute equaliser, this time its a 90th. Joe Allen volleys home.

 At Emirates. #afc: Cech, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Gabriel, Monreal; Coquelin, Ramsey; Campbell, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud. 
 Pattern of this game looks basically set already. #afc dominating the ball and territory, #swans trying to soak it up and hit on the break. 
#afc 1-0 #Swans Great goal. Sanchez finds Campbell's run and he scoops the ball on the turn past Fabianski. ://bit.ly/AFC-Swan

#afc 1-2 #Swans Remarkable. Williams heads home Sigurdsson's free-kick.
 Actually, he bundled it over the line as Cech came out to deal with it. #afc have 15 minutes to salvage something. ://bit.ly/AFC-Swan

 #afc: Ospina, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Gabriel, Gibbs; Elneny, Coquelin; Ramsey, Ozil, Sanchez; Welbeck. 
 Surprising #afc line up. Wenger paying huge respect to Spurs by playing two holding midfielders. Big day for Elneny, Gibbs too. 
Monreal has a slight calf problem. More fatigue than anything else. Still fit enough for the #afc bench.
#thfc 0-1 #afc Ramsey flicks Bellerin's shot past Lloris.
HT 0-1 #afc Spurs were dominant but #afc grew in belief as the half wore on. #thfc energy levels face another test. ://bit.ly/TotAfc-Derby

 On @5liveSport just after 1pm talking #afc v #watfordfc, Costa and #cfc. 
 #afc put the ball out as Guedioura lies injured. Arsenal fan in front of the press box:   We're always too f***ing nice! F*** 'em!   
 #afc aren't   always nice   after all. Two-footed tackle from Gabriel on Deeney. #watfordfc players incensed. 
HT 0-0 Gabriel should have been sent off for #afc.  Ighalo wasted two very good openings for #watfordfc. Finely poised.
 Arsenal say 58,346 tickets sold today. Empty seats dotted around the stadium so actual attendance less. Would guess low 50s. 
#afc 0-1 #Watford Ighalo rolls Gabriel and scores. Goal came from a throw-in. Dreadful defending.
#afc 0-2 #watfordfc Fabulous strike from Guedioura. Plenty of anger directed towards the home dugout now.
#afc 1-2 #watfordfc Excellent goal. Welbeck plays a one-two with Ozil before curling a shot past Pantilimon.

Rain lashing down here at Camp Nou. Feel for those fans (most of them) not under cover. Arsenal fans probably looking for cover anyway...
 Mertesacker dropped, Flamini, Iwobi and Elneny all start for #afc. 
 #afc: Ospina, Bellerin, Gabriel, Koscielny, Monreal; Flamini, Elneny; Iwobi, Ozil, Sanchez; Welbeck. 
Huge night for Iwobi. Flamini's last hurrah - #afc midfield provided no cover in 4-1 defeat here in 2010. Massive job for him and Elneny.
 Without Coquelin & Walcott/Campbell (& maybe PM), this is arguably #afc's strongest available team right now. Giroud off form for a while. 
 Checked with #afc officials- Coquelin not injured at all, pure rotation (making it more surprising) ://bit.ly/FCBvsAFC

 @DarrenArsenal1 pro-Arsenal, anti-Arsenal, pro-Wenger, anti-Wenger...I struggle to keep up. Always lazy though... 
 #afc insist Jack Wilshere hasn't suffered a setback in his recovery from injury as rumoured. Club say he's   progressing well  . 
 Wenger:   #afc has values and one is we respect our contracts. That shouldn't be a surprise. I'm here for 19 yrs and have always done that.   
Also asked AW about Granit Xhaka. Said #afc compiling shortlist but wouldn't say who. Did say he'd show me the list. I'll keep you posted...

 #afc: Cech, Bellerin, Gabriel, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Elneny; Iwobi, Ozil, Sanchez; Welbeck 
This has started like one of those occasions where both team and crowd are mired in introspection about what might have been. #afc
#afc 1-0 #cpfc Sanchez scores after a Welbeck chip over the defence.
HT 1-0 #afc This game meandered along for large spells but a neat link-up between Welbeck and Sanchez gives #afc the egde.
 #afc 1-1 #cpfc Bolasie levels things up here, cutting inside and beating Cech at his near post. 
#afc's faint title hopes - and they were tenuous to start with - are extinguished by that result. No FA Cup to mask the misery either.
@jamiecweir Was just thinking something similar. #mufc could be 1pt behind #afc by the time Arsenal kick-off v West Brom...
 #afc's failure to see games out has cost them. (PL only) Average mins leading per game: #afc 32.1, #lcfc 32.0, #thfc 29.2, #mcfc 28.8. 
 Goals scored – conceded in last 10 mins: Manchester City 13 – 4, Leicester 11 – 4, Tottenham 9 – 5, Arsenal 6 – 6. 
It is the familiarity of it all which is breeding contempt at #afc. Comment on #afc 1-1 #cpfc:://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/forget-the-title-arsenal-s-leading-issue-leaves-them-scrapping-for-a-top-four-finish-a3227581.html …
 Wenger asked about if #afc have interest in Mahrez:   No, and if it was I wouldn't speak about it....it is not the case.   
Wenger says once again he will honour his contract at Arsenal. Dismisses possibility of leaving this summer.

Jack Wilshere is on the bench for #afc at Sunderland today.
 (Finally) at Stadium of Light. #afc: Cech, Bellerin, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Monreal; Elneny, Ramsey; Sanchez, Ozil, Iwobi; Giroud. 
 #afc fans here singing for Danny Welbeck. No sign of activity on the Arsenal bench here. 0-0, 63 mins gone. 
FT 0-0 Both sides created enough chances to win it but a draw probablky the right result. Jack's back - positive for #afc and #eng.

 #mcfc v #afc teamsheet:
://bit.ly/MANCvARS pic.twitter.com/Utj2izdCGA 
More cautious approach from #afc has paid off in last two meetings with #mcfc but this looks an attacking line-up on paper.
 Given the stick #afc take for it, only fair to report empty seats dotted around the Etihad at KO for their/Pellegrini's last home game. 
 #mcfc 1-0 #afc Aguero gives City the lead, smart left foot finish from inside the box. ://bit.ly/MANCvARS  
#mcfc 1-1 #afc Giroud heads home an immediate equaliser. ://bit.ly/MANCvARS 
HT 1-1 Entertaining. #afc trying to soak it up & hit on the break as in previous meetings. Both sides a little shaky at the back.
#mcfc 2-1 #afc Wonderful goal from De Bruyne. Great control and skill to work an opening before firing past Cech.
#mcfc 2-2 #afc Fine Giroud layoff and Sanchez levels it up from the edge of the box.
FT 2-2 #afc or #thfc will finish second. #mcfc or #mufc will finish fourth. #eng sweat on Welbeck's availability.
 #afc fans still in the ground chanting   There's only one Arsene Wenger.   
 Wilshere says Welbeck is   in hell   ://bit.ly/Welb-Hell  & calls on #afc to prove top dogs in north London again: ://bit.ly/NL-Bragging  
Was told #afc feared the worse straight away but Welbeck out for 9 months after knee surgery is about as bad as it could have been.
 Wenger suggests Welbeck injury may change #afc transfer plans, hinting they could be in the market for a striker (they should be already!) 
Wenger denies new #afc contract talks & insists next season will decide his fate: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-denies-he-will-be-offered-new-twoyear-arsenal-contract-but-won-t-rule-out-staying-a3247051.html …

#afc 1-0 #avfc Giroud heads past Bunn. Didn't take long.
HT 1-0 #afc Arsenal should be out of sight but #thfc score means they are now on course for highest PL finish since 2005. Funny old game.
Not always the case - far from it in fact - but #afc majority shareholder Stan Kroenke is here at Emirates Stadium today.
#afc are getting sloppy and ragged here. #avfc growing in confidence a little.
Who said #afc fans don't care about finishing above #thfc? Big cheer as Newcastle go 3-1 up against Spurs.
 #afc fans:   Tottenham Hotspur...its happened again.   
#afc 2-0 #avfc Giroud converts at the near post. Looks like they are going to be second after all.
#afc 3-0 #avfc Giroud completes his hat-trick.

HT 1-1 Credit #afc for forcing an equaliser but subdued from the home side so far. Perez quiet (lacking service). ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-vs-southampton-live-team-news-latest-score-and-goal-updates-a3341666.html …
 Perez's debut is over- gets good reception. Giroud on. Oxlade-Chamberlain off for Sanchez as #afc look to find a winner. 1-1, 62mins

FT 2-1 #afc Don't think we've heard the last of that penalty decision. Important win for Arsenal though.
At Parc des Princes for #afc presser. Counted 5 pictures of Zlatan adorning the stadium surrounds. PSG slowly adjusting to life without him.

 #psg 1-0 #afc Cavani, unmarked, heads home from inside the box. Nightmare start for Arsenal. 
HT 1-0 #psg Cavani could have a hat-trick. #afc lucky to still be in this. Wenger looked furious at individual mistakes throughout the half.
#psg 1-1 #afc Sanchez smashes home an equaliser. Wenger was going to bring Perez on. Not now.
 FT 1-1 Amazing escape act from #afc. Thanks to Cavani's profligacy, Arsenal have a chance to dictate terms in Group A,

 #afc team: Martinez, Maitland-Niles, Holding, Gabriel, Gibbs; Elneny, Xhaka; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Reine-Adelaide, Akpom; Lucas. 
#nffc 0-1 #afc Xhaka scores from long range - goalkeeper seemed to dive too early.
HT 0-1 #afc Visitors have made their superior quality tell so far but #nffc remain a threat going forward. Still a job to do for #afc here.
Penalty to Arsenal

#afc 1-0 #Swansea Walcott steals in to score from close range.
 #afc 2-0 #Swansea More poor defending, Walcott in acres of space and turns it home from close range. 
#afc 2-1 #Swans Out of nothing the visitors are back in it. Xhaka loses the ball to Sigurdsson and he bends a shot past Cech.
 HT 2-1 #afc Good going forward but performance undermined by some complacency at the back. Scoring not over, I'd suggest. 
#afc 3-1 #Swansea Fabulous volley from Ozil high into the net
 #afc 3-2 #Swansea Fine play from Barrow who beats Monreal and then finds Gonzalez Borja Baston, who scores from close range.

 At Emirates. #afc team: Ospina, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Gibbs; Cazorla, Coquelin; Walcott, Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Sanchez. 
#afc 1-0 #Ludogorets Fabulous dinked finish from Sanchez. He's been brilliant in the first 12 minutes.
 #afc could have put this game out of sight already but Ludogorets a real threat on the break. Air of agitation in the stadium, even at 1-0. 
#afc 2-0 #Ludogorets Walcott scores from outside the box (that doesn't happen often). Fine right-foot curling finish.
HT 2-0 #afc Strange half in one sense. Nervous tension in the air in between two superbly taken goals.
#afc 3-0 #Ludogorets Oxlade-Chamberlain extends Arsenal's lead from close range
#afc 4-0 #Ludogorets Wonderful control from Ozil as he races clear and beats Stoyanov.

#afc 6-0 #Ludogorets Ozil hat-trick. A rout.
FT 6-0 #afc Ozil's first hat-trick of his career and Arsenal's seventh consecutive win. Giant leap towards last 16 too given PSG win.
 #afc were excellent going forward tonight. Afterwards, Wenger used that word again:   humility  . ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-wary-of-arsenal-slip-against-ludogorets-a3372901.html …

 At Emirates. #afc: Cech, Debuchy, Mustafi, Koscieny, Monreal; Elneny, Xhaka; Walcott, Ozil, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Sanchez. 
#afc 1-0 #Bournemouth Shambolic. Error from Cook gifts Sanchez possession and he scores.
#afc 1-1 #Bournemouth Wilson converts the spot-kick after Monreal was adjudged to have fouled him. Looked soft to me.
 HT 1-1 A few boos for #afc, more for referee Mike Jones. Tempo in Arsenal's passing an issue again. Finely poised. 
#afc 2-1 #Bournemouth Walcott heads home Monreal's cross.
#afc 3-1 #Bournemouth Sanchez finishes a breakway move - sharp assist from Giroud - to finish this off.

 #afc fans:   Stand up if you hate Tottenham.  
#saintsfc fans:   Stand up if you're 1-0 up.   
#afc 0-2 #saintsfc Well worked goal finished by Bertrand inside the box. Nothing less than they deserve.
Elneny walks off with an injury here. Things going from bad to worse for #afc.
HT 0-2 #saintsfc Abject first half from #afc compounded by Elneny injury. Not much on the bench to help - only senior player left now is Ox.
Wasn't sure this could get much worse from #afc but the amount of time #saintsfc players have on the ball at the moment is shocking.
 FT 0-2 #saintsfc Aside from a brief rally near the end, Arsenal were dreadful. One consolation for Wenger: November is over.

 #afc: Ospina, Gabriel, Holding, Koscielny, Gibbs; Xhaka, Ramsey; Iwobi, Ozil, Perez; Sanchez. 
#fcbasel 0-1 #afc Great play to open up the Swiss side and Perez is left with a tap in.
 Not sure how many opportunities we'll have to say this so, even though its early on, #afc top of the group as things stand... 
#fcbasel 0-2 #afc Gibbs' low drive it only parried straight into Perez's path and he finishes from close range.

Of course. Bayern v #afc
Sense of inevitability for #afc but Bayern have at least struggled a bit this season (although they are now top of the B-liga).
Sanchez and Ozil's importance to #afc is a hot topic these days. Theo Walcott reveals another side to them: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/theo-walcott-alexis-sanchez-and-mesut-ozil-are-winners-and-inspire-arsenal-players-work-harder-a3418881.html …

FT 2-1 #mcfc Impressive improvement from City but #afc let a big away game slip from their grasp for the second time in a week.

 At Emirates. #afc: Cech, Bellerin, Gabriel, Koscielny, Monreal; Elneny, Xhaka; Iwobi, Sanchez, Perez; Giroud. 
Sanchez's shot was so fiercely struck earlier the officials had to change the matchball. A rare sight. #afc on top but 0-0 after 15 mins.
#afc 1-0 #cpfc Goal of the season contender. Fabulous flowing move ends with Giroud acrobatically flicking the ball into the net via the bar
HT 1-0 #afc Stunner from Giroud gives #afc deserved lead. #cpfc resemble a team setup for 0-0 & unsure how to adapt. ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-vs-crystal-palace-live-latest-score-goal-updates-and-premier-league-team-news-at-emirates-a3430446.html …

FT 2-0 #afc Game peaked with Giroud's brilliance. Cech needed to keep out brief #cpfc rally but comfortable home win://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-vs-crystal-palace-live-latest-score-goal-updates-and-premier-league-team-news-at-emirates-a3430446.html …
Wenger says Giroud's goal against Palace today is in the top five during his time at Arsenal.
At Vitality Stadium. Ozil hasn't travelled for #afc.
 #afc: Cech, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Xhaka; Ramsey, Iwobi, Sanchez; Giroud. 
#Bournemouth 1-0 #afc Bellerin is a top defender but he won't like watching that back. Daniels beats him far too easily and converts.
#afcb 2-0 #afc Wilson converts after Xhaka fouled Fraser. Mountain to climb for #afc now.
 HT 2-0 #afcb Home side everything #afc aren't: energetic, focused & dynamic. Big test of Wenger & his team's   mental strength   here... 
 Dizzy penalty challenge for a few fans on the pitch at half time here. As they run up, they look like Arsenal did in that first half. 
#afcb 3-0 #afc Fraser beats Bellerin and then slots a finish past Cech. Wenger furious as he thinks Bellerin was fouled.
   This is embarrassing,   sing the #afc fans. Hard to disagree with that. 
#afcb 3-1 #afc  Sanchez converts at the back post after Giroud helps on Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross.
 #afcb 3-2 #afc Perez hits a superb volley from a tight angle after Giroud's layoff. They couldn't, could they? 
 #afcb 3-3 #afc Giroud equalises in stoppage time. Remarkable game, remarkable comeback. 
FT 3-3 Superb game. Jekyll and Hyde performance from #afc containing reasons why they could yet win the PL & also why they probably won't.
Are #afc battle-hardened for a title race or the same flawed top four team as before? Report on #afcb 3-3 #afc: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/olivier-giroud-celebration-shows-arsenal-lack-title-mindset-but-gunners-live-to-fight-another-day-a3432181.html …
 FT 2-0 #thfc Deserved win which breathes fresh life into the PL title race. #thfc into 3rd, above #afc who drop to fifth. 
 Wenger says he will rest Koscielny and Sanchez against Preston, Ospina will start in goal. #afc

Arrived at the Liberty Stadium for Swansea v Arsenal. Team news shortly. pic.twitter.com/SZUQklv608
 #AFC: Cech, Gabriel, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Ramsey, Xhaka; Sanchez, Ozil, Iwobi; Giroud. 
#afc's recent habit of starting poorly has continued here. Nowhere near as bad as Bournemouth/Preston but Swansea growing in belief. 0-0.
#Swansea 0-1 #Arsenal Giroud turns the ball home from close range after Swansea fail to clear.
 HT 0-1 #afc Scoreline a little harsh on Swansea. Although goal had a clumsy climax, it came at the end of an excellent move. 
#Swansea 0-2 #afc Iwobi's shot takes a huge deflection and loops over Fabianski.
#Swansea 0-3 #afc Naughton own goal from Iwobi's cross.
#Swansea 0-4 #afc Sanchez scores from close range. That is the cue for the home fans to start filing out.
 Sanchez & Ozil taken off with 12 mins left here. #afc so comfortable, Wenger could spend the rest of the game talking contracts with them. 
FT 0-4 #afc Arsenal recovered from a slow start to rack up an easy win in the end. Important after recent away day misery.

 At Emirates. #afc: Cech, Gabriel, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Ramsey, Xhaka; Iwobi, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud. 
Teamsheet for Arsenal v Burnley: pic.twitter.com/TfNc0EI684
#afc not quite on it in the final third yet but brighter start than in recent games. Burnley occupying #afc by keeping two up when possible.
 HT 0-0 Some agitation around Emirates after a frustrating half for #afc. Burnley defending resolutely, #afc not passing with enough tempo. 
#afc 1-0 #Burnley Mustafi heads home Ozil's corner.
Xhaka will be banned for four matches (unless #afc win an appeal). Contact looked minimal but diving in like that invites trouble.
#afc 1-1 #Burnley Gray converts from the spot. Wenger furious.
Penalty to Arsenal
#afc 2-1 #Burnley Sanchez converts - panenka - to give Arsenal a dramatic win.
FT 2-1 #afc Pandemonium at the end here. Breathless finish but ultimately a vital win for Arsenal.

Piece from this morning's press conference at Colney. #afc fans probably expected it anyway but Wenger says no incomings tomorrow. s://twitter.com/standardsport/status/826015527688663040 …
 At Emirates. #afc team: Cech, Gabriel, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Ramsey; Iwobi, Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud. 
#afc 0-1 #Watford Kaboul's low drive is deflected off Ramsey past Cech.
#afc 0-2 #Watford Shambolic defending. Capoue dances through and his shot is saved by Cech but the rebound falls to Deeney who converts.
This is possibly worse than Bournemouth away from Arsenal. And that really is saying something.
 HT 0-2 #Watford. Hey, remember when teams worked out you stop #afc by pressing high up so they make mistakes? Well, that's happening. Again. 
Giroud off at half-time. Walcott on for #afc
#afc 1-2 #Watford Iwobi scores from Sanchez's cross to halve the deficit.
FT 1-2 #Watford #afc improved (couldn't get any worse) but Watford held on for a deserved win. Title challenge in tatters.
Wenger's future is back on the agenda after Watford defeat reopens old wounds. Report on #afc 1-2 #Watford:://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-1-watford-2-arsene-wenger-has-no-margin-for-error-at-chelsea-as-defeat-leaves-gunners-on-a3455496.html …

 AW says #afc tried to sign Kante when he was in France & at #lcfc. Why didn't it happen?   Its quite obvious when you look where he's gone.   
Wenger on how close #afc came to signing Kante and tomorrow's crunch game at #cfc:://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-reveals-arsenal-twice-failed-to-sign-chelsea-midfielder-ngolo-kante-and-believes-hes-a3457481.html …
Think part of the Wenger-Kante issue is how wedded #afc are to analytics. Plenty of detail on that in this book: s://www.amazon.co.uk/Deal-Inside-World-Super-Agent/dp/1472123026 …
 #afc: Cech, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Walcott, Ozil, Iwobi; Sanchez. 
#cfc 1-0 #afc Cech saves Costa's header but Alonso turns home the rebound.
#afc look vulnerable to #cfc's aerial power. Bellerin off injured which means Hazard v Gabriel on #afc's right...
 Atmosphere hits a lull here. #afc fans sing:   Is this is the Emirates?   
HT 1-0 #cfc Debate about the goal but personally think no foul. #cfc on top but #afc could be level had Gabriel taken great chance.
#cfc 2-0 #afc Fantastic strength from Hazard as he scores a stunning solo goal.
#cfc 3-1 #afc Giroud scores with a near-post header. Conte was applauding the fans singing his name when it happened.
FT 3-1 #cfc Deserved win which takes Chelsea 12 points clear and ends #afc's title hopes. Difficult questions for Wenger now.

Teams are out for Bayern v Arsenal pic.twitter.com/K1kVrXp7Xo
Looks like usual 4-2-3-1 shape for #afc with the ball. Ox and Iwobi dropping into more of a 4-4-1-1 without it as they try to stay compact.
#Bayern 1-0 #afc Arsenal sit off Robben and he takes advantage by curling a shot into the top corner.
Penalty to Arsenal
#Bayern 1-1 #afc Sanchez equalises from the rebound after Neuer saved his penalty.
#Bayern 2-1 #afc Lewandowski climbs highest to plant a header past Ospina.
#Bayern 3-1 #afc Thiago rifles a close range finish past Ospina. Magnificent flick from Lewandowski to assist.
This is precisely the moment where #afc have to remember the tie is 180 minutes long. 3-1 wouldn't be a total disaster.
 #Bayern 4-1 #afc Arsenal are capitulating. Thiago scores again, unfortunate deflection off Xhaka. 
#Bayern 5-1 #afc Muller adds a fifth. Tie over.
Oxlade-Chamberlain the only #afc player to go and acknowledge the away fans. Just given his shirt to someone in the crowd too. pic.twitter.com/clE9mqTsUQ

 #afc represented in the Directors' Box by Sir Chips Keswick, Dick Law and Ivan Gazidis (who wasn't at Bayern game). 
Sutton 0-1 #afc Perez takes advantage of space for the first time and his shot finds the far corner.
HT 0-1 #afc ahead with clinical breakaway but doesn't appear to be 105 places between the teams. Sutton unable to produce in final third.
 #Sutton 0-2 #afc Walcott doubles Arsenal's lead as Sutton drop deep, inviting pressure. 
 #afc fans:   Lincoln City, we're coming for you.   
Sanchez is coming on for Arsenal...
FT 0-2 #afc weren't at their best but did enough to reach the QFs. Sutton deserved a goal for their endeavour. Never 105 places between them

 At Anfield. #afc: Cech; Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Xhaka, Coquelin; Ox, Iwobi, Welbeck; Giroud. Sanchez on the bench. 
No fitness issue with Alexis Sanchez. He's been dropped. #afc
#lfc 1-0 #afc Firmino finishes high into the roof of the net.
 After just 17 minutes #afc fans break into brief chant of   Alexis Sanchez baby  . (Note - he isn't warming up to trigger it). 
 #afc fans:   We've had a shot, we've had a shot.   Expectations pretty low by the sounds of it. 
 #lfc 2-0 #afc Good composure from Firmino in the box to pick out Mane, and he fires low past Cech. 
 HT 2-0 #lfc Forget tactics, team selection etc. Worst aspect of this is Arsenal are being out-fought all over the pitch. 
#lfc 2-1 #afc Welbeck scores to give Arsenal a lifeline.
#afc fans booing Wenger's decision to take Welbeck off and replace him with Walcott.
#lfc 3-1 #afc That seals it. Fabulously worked goal as Lallana releases Origi and Wijnaldum turns home his cross.
FT 3-1 #lfc One 'Wenger Out' banner on display. Second half was better but #afc just didn't compete for long enough in the game.

Sanchez starts for #afc
 At Emirates. #afc: Ospina, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Ramsey, Xhaka; Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Welbeck; Sanchez. 
#afc 1-0 #Bayern Walcott thrashes a shot past Neuer high into the net. Its on...
HT 1-0 #afc (2-5 agg) Much better from #afc - Walcott in particular - but still plenty to do. Need a 2nd half like Bayern had in the Allianz
 #afc 1-1 #Bayern Koscielny sent off after fouling Lewandowski, who converts the penalty. 
#afc 1-2 #Bayern Robben takes advantage of poor defending to slot past Ospina. Fans start streaming out. Still more than 20 minutes to play.
 Bayern taunting #afc (and #eng fans) here:   It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home.   
 Section of #afc fans turning on owner rather than Wenger now:   F*** off Stan Kroenke, get out of our club.   
 #afc 1-3 #Bayern Costa, on as a sub, cuts inside on his left foot and bends a shot past Ospina. 
#afc 1-4 #Bayern Vidal now heaps further misery on Arsenal after a poor defensive pass. Still 10 minutes to play...
#afc 1-5 #Bayern The visitors race through again and Vidal has a tap-in.
 FT 1-5 #Bayern (2-10 on agg) Twice Koscielny went off, twice #afc fell apart. Out at the last 16 stage for the 7th consecutive season. 
 Wenger in. Says #afc should have had a penalty for foul on Walcott.   After that, the referee killed the game.   Lewandowski offside for pen. 
 Kroenke & Gazidis cannot shy away any longer. If Wenger warrants a 2-yr deal, tell us why. Comment on #afc CL exit: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-cannot-be-allowed-to-decide-his-destiny-he-is-holding-arsenal-back-a3484386.html …

 Wenger won't be charged by UEFA over ref comments. #afc charged after pitch invasion, Bayern charged for throwing toilet rolls onto pitch. 
 Good to finally see something from #afc board but hard not to feel that statement is a little too   thank you for your interest   aka the AGM. 
 At Emirates. #afc: Cech, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Gibbs; Ramsey, Xhaka; Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sanchez; Giroud. 
Third injury delay here helping Lincoln gather their breath & composure. #afc lacklustre so far.
#afc 1-0 #Lincoln Arsenal eventually work an opening and Walcott sidefoots home.
 HT 1-0 #afc fortunate to be ahead after underwhelming first half. Lincoln, top of the NL, were matching them stride for stride until then. 
#afc 2-0 #Lincoln Giroud converts from close range. Not much of a celebration. Looks like they just want to get out of here.
#afc 3-0 #Lincoln Waterfall turns Gibbs' cross into his own net. Game over.
#afc 4-0 #Lincoln Sanchez curls home a fourth from the edge of the box. Job done.
FT 5-0 #afc Underwhelming start but in the end a comfortable win which will at least help morale. Lincoln (& their fans) can be proud.
Wenger discussed possible summer transfer targets with senior #afc players recently. Indicates his thinking but that was before bad run.
Wenger has denied any PSG contract offer. But logical to think that is still his most likely destination at this stage if he leaves #afc.

 At Emirates. #afc: Ospina, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Xhaka, Coquelin; Walcott, Ozil, Sanchez; Welbeck. 
#afc 0-1 #mcfc Sane rounds Ospina and scores.
#afc badly need someone to get a grip of this. #mcfc threatening to run riot. 0-1 after 10 minutes.
#afc 1-1 #mcfc Walcott equalises as City fail to deal with a corner.
#afc 1-2 #mcfc What a response. More shambolic defending. Aguero finishes.
Made the point before but couldn't see any #afc players talking to each other in aftermath of Aguero's goal. Most stood motionless.
 HT 1-2 #mcfc Poor defending from both teams, #mcfc better in final third. (Another) huge test of character for Arsenal from here. 
He's not alone in this but... #afc just lost possession and Sanchez stood still - just a few yards away - hands on hips.
 #afc 2-2 #mcfc Mustafi equalises, climbing highest to head home a corner. 
FT 2-2 Both sides seemingly settled for a point in the end. #afc fortunate to escape Monreal handball shout in stoppage-time.

 #whufc doing a good job of defending the width of their 18-yard box, denying #afc space to play. 0-0, 30 minutes gone. 
HT 0-0 #afc better as half wore on but #whufc holding firm for now. Arsenal need to try and move the ball quicker.
#afc 1-0 #whufc Ozil's shot from the edge of the box finds its way in.
#afc 2-0 #whufc Flowing move ends with Walcott sidefooting past Randolph.
 On the pitch, Giroud makes it 3-0. Off it, stewards having to hold a strong line as #whufc and #afc taunt each other and throw objects. 
FT 3-0 #afc Good value for their win in the end. #whufc held firm for almost an hour but #afc's quality eventually told. #afc into 5th.

Good read from @giuseppemuro on Jason Puncheon ahead of #cpfc v #afc tonight: s://twitter.com/standardsport/status/851409977050845184 …
 At Selhurst Park. #afc: Martinez, Bellerin, Gabriel, Mustafi, Monreal; Elneny, Xhaka; Walcott, Ozil, Sanchez; Welbeck. 
 #afc still not out to warm-up, aside from goalkeepers, after arriving late. #cpfc been going through their paces for some time.pic.twitter.com/oVwUGuGAxy 
#cpfc 1-0 #afc Townsend converts after Zaha slips as he crosses.
HT 1-0 #cpfc Palace deserve their lead - brighter & more purposeful. #afc can't cope with Benteke but aren't without threat at the other end
Giroud had a real knack for late goals earlier in the season. #afc need another one from him now. Still 1-0 #cpfc
 #cpfc 2-0 #afc Zaha picks out Cabaye, who curls home a fine second. 
#cpfc 3-0 #afc Milivojevic converts after Townsend was brought down by Martinez.
 #afc fans:   Arsene Wenger, we want you to go.   #cpfc fans:   Arsene Wenger, we want you to stay.   
 FT 3-0 #cpfc Palace superb, #afc abject. Fans calling for Wenger to go, team underperforming. Hard to see how a 2-year deal can be justified

Four pages of #afc fallout in tonight's Standard (plus due recognition of #cpfc's excellent display).

At the Riverside Stadium. Just starting to rain. Do #afc like it up north on a Bank Holiday Monday? We're about to find out. pic.twitter.com/eU8Ox4zAW1
#afc look like they are going with three at the back...
#Boro 0-1 #afc Sanchez scores with a sublime free-kick.
 #afc fans singing:   We're leading away, we're leading away, how s*** must you be, we're leading away.   
HT 0-1 #afc One moment of quality from Sanchez is the difference so far.
#Boro 1-1 #afc Negredo stabs home Downing's cross at the end of a quick counter-attack.
#Boro 1-2 #afc Ozil smashes home from Ramsey's chest-down.
 Wenger shows he is open to different ideas after all. Only question is, has it come too late? #Boro 1-2 #afc: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-profit-as-arsene-wenger-shows-he-can-move-with-the-times-a3516936.html …

 49 games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham, Man Utd and Liverpool: 33 goals.

#afc go three at the back again.
 #afc: Cech, Gabriel, Koscielny, Holding; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, Xhaka, Monreal; Sanchez, Ozil; Giroud. 
 HT 0-0 Shades of Jan 2015 about this in #afc's approach. But to repeat that win (2-0 away at #mcfc), they'll have to keep riding their luck. 
#afc 0-1 #mcfc Aguero breaksaway and finishes past Bravo.
#afc 1-1 #mcfc Wing-back to wing-back. Oxlade-Chamberlain crosses and Monreal equalises.
#afc fans singing for Danny Welbeck to come on here. Giroud has not had one of his most effective days.
#afc 2-1 #mcfc Sanchez reacts quickest to turn the ball home from close range.
FT 2-1 #afc Arsenal find a way. Tremendous resilience. Wenger reaches 8th FA Cup Final. Big celebration from him at full-time.
Nice touch from Mikel Arteta to wait for former #afc team-mates and congratulate them before disappearing down the tunnel.
Wenger was looking for a result to begin justifying a new deal. Now he's found it. Thoughts on #afc 2-1 #mcfc:://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenals-fa-cup-win-over-manchester-city-was-the-result-arsene-wenger-needed-to-help-justify-new-a3522191.html …
Wenger says #afc have had no approach from Marseille for Olivier Giroud and want to keep him at the club.
Belated arrival at the Emirates. #afc v #lcfc teamsheet:pic.twitter.com/H1853Wyksg
Agitation among the home fans as #afc are guilty of overplaying against a compact #lcfc defence. Still 0-0.
HT 0-0 #afc the better side as #lcfc have rode their luck at times but more required in the final third. Need to move it a little quicker.
Welbeck on and a switch to a back four for #afc
#afc 1-0 #lcfc Monreal's shot hits Giroud and goes in. A huge slice of luck.
FT 1-0 #afc Not quite the full-time euphoria of Sunday from Wenger but clenched fists nevertheless. Arsenal get over the line.
On the whistle piece from Emirates Stadium after #afc 1-0 #lcfc:s://twitter.com/standardsport/status/857336908615168002 …
Wenger's 3-4-3 has helped #afc's defence but who should lead the attack against #thfc? Thoughts on #afc 1-0 #lcfc:://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-facing-a-dilemma-over-who-will-spearhead-arsenal-s-attack-in-showdown-at-tottenham-a3525181.html …
Wenger says Mustafi out for another two weeks. #afc
 Wenger says #afc watched Dele Alli   many, many times   when he was at Milton Keynes. Asked how close a deal was, he said:   I don't know.   
Wenger says #thfc finishing above #afc this year will not indicate a shift in power - says they have to do more than one year.
 At #thfc training ground where Pochettino plays down #afc rivalry and says:   I'll be very disappointed if we don't win the title.   
 Piece from #thfc's training ground as Pochettino insists Spurs are targeting the PL title, not finishing above #afc: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/mauricio-pochettino-my-aim-is-not-to-finish-above-arsenal-but-to-take-tottenham-above-all-19-clubs-a3526566.html … 
 #afc: Cech, Gabriel, Koscielny, Monreal; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, Xhaka, Gibbs; Ozil, Sanchez; Giroud. 
 Er, he's been booked in Arsenal's last two matches... 
View from the press box. Teams are out. #thfc v #afc for the last time at White Hart Lane. pic.twitter.com/jSiGb3Yj8m
#afc riding their luck here as #thfc waste two glorious chances. Wenger now discussing positioning with Gabriel during break in play. 0-0.
HT 0-0 #thfc should be ahead. #afc have had their dangerous moments but need more from Giroud in attack.
#thfc 1-0 #afc Alli turns the ball home from close range. White Hart Lane erupts.
 #thfc 2-0 #afc After being fouled by Gabriel in the box, Kane steps up to double Tottenham's advantage. 
It is moments like this when Wenger's insistence on waiting to make substitutions does #afc no favours.
FT 2-0 #thfc Deserved win which confirms #thfc will finish above #afc for first time since 1995. Cech #afc's best player by a mile.
 Wenger on 17-point difference between #thfc and #afc:   The points are the points. They do not come from heaven. That's it.   
At Emirates. #afc v #mufc teamsheet:pic.twitter.com/MuDEt12nzO
 HT 0-0 All a bit sterile for an #afc v #mufc game. Both sides have had chances but goalkeepers on top so far. Subdued atmosphere, too. 
 #afc 1-0 #mufc Out of nothing, Xhaka scores. 
#afc 2-0 #mufc Welbeck heads home from close range.
FT 2-0 #afc Deserved win in the end. #afc keep their top 4 hopes alive for another few days at the very least. #mufc never offered enough.
 Wenger says he watched the Liverpool game before #afc's match:   I've seen the penalty given by the referee...it was very nice.   
 Mourinho on #afc fans:   I'm happy for them. I left Highbury, they were crying, I left the Emirates, they were crying. Its the first time.  . 
Welbeck now in pole position to lead #afc attack at Giroud's expense after #mufc win. Comment on #afc 2-0 #mufc:://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/danny-welbeck-shows-he-s-ready-to-lead-arsenal-attack-as-jose-mourinho-launches-fresh-dig-at-arsene-a3533236.html …
 #cfc fans take over the #afc chant...:   Tottenham Hotspur, its happened again.   
 AW rejected suggestion #afc will appoint a Director of Football.   As long as I'm manager, I'll decide what happens on the technical front.   
 Mesut Ozil on his critics, his form and his statistics ahead of Southampton v Arsenal tonight: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/mesut-ozil-on-his-battle-for-perception-at-arsenal-my-statistics-do-the-talking-a3534956.html … 
 Dick Law quoted in Brazil suggesting   results will tell   re Wenger's future. That's been true for a while but uncertainty not helping #afc. 
Glorious evening at St Mary's Stadium. Southampton v Arsenal teams to follow shortly. pic.twitter.com/xBzlMS8PVn
 #afc: Cech, Holding, Mustafi, Monreal; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, Xhaka, Gibbs; Sanchez, Ozil; Welbeck. 
 ICYMI: Mesut Ozil on social media, ignoring the critics and his form ahead of Southampton v Arsenal: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/mesut-ozil-on-his-battle-for-perception-at-arsenal-my-statistics-do-the-talking-a3534956.html … 
 Empty seats dotted about, Southampton safely in mid-table, good chance in theory for #afc to close the gap on the top four. We're underway. 
 Given what is at stake, you'd think #afc would be playing with a bit more urgency & intensity than they are. Southampton started the better. 
 Better spell from #afc now. Started to push Southampton back. Neither goalkeeper yet to be tested though. 0-0, 25 mins gone. 
HT 0-0 More needed from #afc who may just need reminding there is no margin for error here.
Southampton 0-1 #Arsenal Sanchez turns brilliantly and shows great composure to put the visitors in front.
 FT 0-2 #afc Game turned with that turn from Sanchez. #afc keep top four hopes alive, 3 pts behind #mcfc. Next up: Stoke (a). 
On the whistle piece from St Mary's Stadium after Southampton 0-2 Arsenal: s://twitter.com/standardsport/status/862414355220111360 …
Sanchez has not been exempt from wider criticism of #afc but he remains their match-winner. Piece on #afc's 2-0 win: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/alexis-sanchez-shows-why-arsenal-are-prepared-to-pay-him-300000-a-week-a3536111.html …
 #afc: Cech; Holding, Mustafi, Koscielny; Bellerin, Coquelin, Xhaka, Monreal; Özil, Sanchez; Giroud. 
 Oxlade-Chamberlain (hamstring) and Gibbs (calf) not risked today - #afc believe both are minor injuries, should be available again soon. 
 Whole stadium singing about Wenger now. #afc fans:   Arsene Wenger, he's won more than you.   Stoke:   Arsene Wenger, we want you to stay.   
Better start from #afc than at Southampton. Beginning to boss possession now and create chances. Stoke offering very little so far.
#Stoke 0-1 #afc Never doubted him. Giroud has a tap-in from Bellerin's cross.
 #afc fans:   1-0 to the football team.   
HT 0-1 #afc Loud boos from the home fans. #afc deserve their lead - much more purpose about their approach. Closing in on the top four...
 Despite the animosity between these clubs, #afc fans applaud Stoke's U23s, U18s, Ladies and Reserves teams as they embark on a lap of honour 
 #afc fans:   How s*** must you be, we're winning away.   
#Stoke 0-2 #afc Ozil doubles Arsenal's advantage. That should be that.
#Stoke 1-2 #afc Crouch gets Stoke back into the game but it looks like handball. Wenger went onto the pitch to remonstrate. Players furious.
 The stadium has come alive here. Suddenly, this final 20 minutes has become a real test of nerve for Arsenal. 
Sanchez is signalling to come off here. Worrying signs for Arsenal.
And then he scores! Incredible. Stoke 1-3 #afc Sanchez finishes in off the post.
#Stoke 1-4 #afc Giroud slides home from close range. Arsenal move to within one point of the top four.
FT 1-4 #afc Impressive victory that moves Arsenal within one point of the top four. Pressure on Liverpool ahead of their trip to West Ham.
There was already talk of a fan boycott of #afc's game against Sunderland on Tues. Can see them staying away in droves after #lfc win today.
 #afc have an interest in Pickford and he's proving why so far. Several good saves already but Arsenal yet find a way through. 0-0, 24th min. 
HT 0-0. #afc well on top but Pickford has been in fine form to keep them out. Game there for the taking though.
#afc go to four at the back with a double change- Welbeck and Iwobi for Ramsey and Gibbs.
 #afc fan slow to return the ball when it drifts out of play. Mustafi screams:   Give me the ball, for f***'s sake!   
#afc 1-0 #Sunderland Ozil and Sanchez combine for the latter to score from close range.
#afc 2-0 #Sunderland Sanchez doubles their lead and that should be that.
FT 2-0 #afc Sanchez makes the difference again. #afc must hope Middlesbrough put up similar resistance at Anfield as Sunderland did here.
#afc have a chance of a top 4 finish. That's more than looked possible a few weeks ago. Comment on #afc's 2-0 win: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/alexis-sanchez-sets-up-final-day-shootout-for-arsenal-but-arsene-wenger-still-insists-top-four-is-a3541166.html …

Usmanov has made a big offer to buy #afc but Kroenke not keen on selling as it stands. Improved offer or no CL could change things.
 At Emirates. #afc: Cech, Holding, Koscielny, Gabriel; Bellerin, Xhaka, Ramsey, Monreal; Sanchez, Ozil; Welbeck. 
#afc 1-0 #efc Reward for a bright start. Unbelievable miss from Welbeck but Bellerin spares his blushes with the follow-up.
 Such a strange moment from Koscielny. #afc were ahead and in control, hadn't been a bad tackle in the game and then out of nowhere, that. 
 #afc 2-0 #efc Sanchez doubles Arsenal's lead. Everton seemed to stop, believing Welbeck was offside in the build-up. 
HT 2-0 #afc #efc seemed to realise near the end of the half that they have a man advantage. Good from #afc but job not yet done. Good game.
More defensive problems for #afc - Gabriel now being stretchered off. Left leg injury. Looked painful. Mertesacker on.
#afc 2-1 #efc Lukaku scores from the spot. Handball given against Holding.
 #afc fans:   Stan Kroenke, get out of our club.   
#afc 3-1 #efc Lovely curled finish from Ramsey settles this game.
FT 3-1 #afc Hard-fought win achieved despite losing Koscielny early on but proved in vain. Fifth place finish means Europa League next year.
Nice touch from the club- image on the screen comprised of the names of #afc fans who have passed away during the season. pic.twitter.com/90DYrxhUsy
Wenger watches on with his staff as #afc players embark on lap of appreciation. pic.twitter.com/fMokVM3Mav
 KSE unequivocal in that statement but for what it is worth, am told there are #afc board members who are sympathetic to Usmanov's overtures. 
Kroenke and the #afc board have hidden behind Wenger for too long. Time to stand up: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/time-for-silent-stan-kroenke-to-speak-up-as-arsenal-fans-vent-their-fury-a3544991.html …

Cover all of London's PL clubs and England but used to just do Arsenal and lack of staff means I still predominantly cover that patch.
 #afc team: Ospina, Holding, Mertesacker, Monreal; Bellerin, Xhaka, Ramsey, Oxlade-Chamberlain; Sanchez, Ozil; Welbeck. 
Nearly ready to go #afc v #cfc:pic.twitter.com/8eud795pKD
#afc 1-0 #cfc Lineman flagged for Ramsey but Sanchez was onside and the goal is given.
Just seen replay of goal. Clear handball from Sanchez - big slice of luck for #afc. #cfc seem in post-PL title slumber at the moment.
Mesut Ozil just made a crunching tackle on Eden Hazard. #afc being bang up for this in a microcosm.
HT 1-0 #afc better all over the pitch & deservedly in front. #cfc need a half-time rocket. And Fabregas to give them more guile in midfield.
Mertesacker is defying conventional wisdom here on 1st start for 13 months. Holding #afc together at the back.
 #afc 1-1 #cfc Costa equalises, chesting the ball down and firing a shot past Ospina. 
#afc 2-1 #cfc Incredible. Instant response. Ramsey puts Arsenal back in front.

Two more years for Wenger at #afc. Club expected to make formal announcement tomorrow.
 #afc confirm Wenger's 2-year deal. Kroenke:   Our ambition is to win the Premier League and other major trophies in Europe...   (1/2)

Atletico Madrid's transfer ban has been upheld until January. Good news for #afc as it removes a major rival in pursuit of Lacazette.
#afc's £87m bid for Mbappe is genuine and has been rejected by Monaco. Story to follow.
 Monaco reject £87m bid from Arsenal for Mbappe. At the very least, a sign Arsenal mean business this summer:
://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/monaco-reject-87m-bid-for-kylian-mbappe-as-arsenal-show-their-intent-to-alexis-sanchez-and-mesut-a3555286.html … 
#afc have held an interest in Pickford for several months. First reported it in Dec. Suspect Sunderland's £30m valuation has put them off.
#afc have appointed fitness expert Darren Burgess to Wenger's backroom staff. Will begin work in July. Story here: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsene-wenger-approves-new-arsenal-role-ex-liverpool-fitness-guru-joins-a3568116.html …
 Am told Huss Fahmy has already started work with #afc, involved with player contracts. Club trying to add greater expertise alongside Wenger 
Interesting #afc are pursuing Lacazette deal while AW believes Mbappe could be tempted away from Monaco. Hard to see them signing both.
FYI- news on Arsenal's attempts to sign Lacazette and speaking to Monaco about Lemar is in tonight's Standard.
Bayern distancing themselves from Sanchez move due to cost. #mcfc not put off by that but #afc reluctant sellers & hope he'll sign new deal. s://twitter.com/standardsport/status/880369445713186817 …
Gazidis defends #afc's handling of Wenger's contract saga at fan Q&A: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal-handled-arsene-wenger-contract-talks-maturely-insists-ceo-ivan-gazidis-a3576836.html …
Lyon softening their stance over £57m asking price for Lacazette at least suggests a willingness to do a deal with #afc. Talks ongoing.
As reported elsewhere - and I know what Aulas has said - but #afc side of deal suggesting Lacazette fee could total £52m with add-ons.
 Regardless, the initial fee is a club record. Player expected to join in time to travel with #afc squad to Australia (they leave on Sunday). 
Jens Lehmann in talks over #afc coaching role: ://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/jens-lehmann-set-for-arsenal-return-as-arsene-wenger-takes-coaching-risk-a3578776.html …
#afc not aware of any fresh setback for Cazorla but no timeframe on return from Achilles. Story here: s://twitter.com/standardsport/status/882190400148078592 …
#afc finalising paperwork on £52m Lacazette transfer this morning. Announcement not expected until late afternoon/evening.
 This is random but someone posing as me on here is claiming that #afc are in talks to sign Pjanic. For clarity, I'm not reporting that. 
 Good insight here from @james_eastham on what Lacazette brings to #afc & the challenge he faces:
://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/alexandre-lacazette-can-prove-to-be-a-bargain-for-arsenal-even-with-club-record-52m-fee-a3581511.html …

 Arsenal Starting XI against Blackburn: Almunia, Sagna, Koscielny, Squillaci, Clichy, Song, Wilshere, Arshavin, Nasri, Walcott, van Persie.

Great attack from Arsenal involving Walcott and Song. Corner.
 Arsenal goal before half time, please. 
 Half Time: Arsenal 0-0 Blackburn - Wilshere missed a sitter, but Almunia's errors could have easily cost us. Subs could prove vital. 
Absolutely disgusting challenge from former Arsenal target Steven N'Zonzi on Koscielny. Straight red card.

 Arsenal XI v Swansea: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Koscielny, Gibbs, Frimpong, Ramsey, Walcott, Arteta, Arshavin, van Persie. 
Arsenal almost take the lead within 60 seconds. Great opportunity for Ramsey after superb work from Arteta.
Straight into the wall from the former Everton midfielder. Good start from Arsenal.
I haven't seen goalkeeping like that since Manuel Almunia was playing last season. Arsenal take the lead through Arshavin. 1-0.

 Arsenal bringing on Coquelin for Frimpong, who has looked very tired during the past 15-20 minutes.

HT: #AFC 1-1 #WWFC - #AFC dominant despite Wolves equaliser against run of play. Walcott & Wilshere would make the difference today if fit.
 Arsenal have decent attacking options on the bench; Ramsey, Chamberlain & Arshavin all available. May prove decisive in latter stages. 
Arsenal edging closer to getting the vital second. Hennessey looks inspired in the Wolves goal.

 Massive boost for #AFC against #CFC. Roberto Di Matteo's side are missing defenders Luiz & Ivanovic, as well as star striker Didier Drogba. 
 Arsenal want £1million for goalkeeper Vito Mannone who is on loan at Hull, according to the Daily Mail. 
Arsenal v Chelsea Preview - ://tinyurl.com/76z7bw9 
Half Time: Arsenal 0-0 Chelsea - #AFC's best chances came towards end of first half. Koscielny unlucky with header. Scrappy game so far.
Full Time: Arsenal 0-0 Chelsea - Drab game in which both sides cancelled each other out. #AFC had better chances & could have won.
Tottenham back where they belong - outside the top four. It seems like a long time ago they were 13 points above #AFC! #NorthLondonIsRed
 Redknapp in March:   Third place isn't out of reach and I still think we will finish above Arsenal, bring it on Arsene.

 Wenger in the May edition of Arsenal Magazine:   A sin bin is worth thinking about in my opinion  . 
 Song's agent:   Alex is one of the most important #AFC players. I don’t think they are going to sell him during the summer transfer window.   
#AFC officials have been in Nigeria finalising details over a pre-season tour there. Announcement expected next month.

 Podolski:   I’m proud to become an #AFC player and am looking forward to playing my first match at and doing my best for all the #AFC fans.   
 Quote of the Season belongs to Tottenham's Rafael Van der Vaart:   There is no chance of Arsenal finishing above Spurs. We're better.

Sol Campbell has confirmed his retirement from football. A true #AFC legend. Future career in punditry? Let's wait and see.

Robin van Persie 'can't wait' to play with Lukas Podolski next season for #AFC. Further evidence that he isn't leaving.
 Van der Vaart:   We look to Arsenal - we were 10 points ahead, now we are one down, but anything is possible.   
AW has hinted that he'll seek to move some of Arsenal's strikers out of the club in the summer. Bendtner & Vela most likely to be sold.

GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 Norwich - Great play from Kieran Gibbs for Yossi Benayoun's 2nd minute goal. #AFC have started superbly. 1-0.
No real surprise at the Emirates. Norwich have dominated the game since Arsenal's goal. Hoolahan smashes it past Szczesny. 1-1.
 Grant Holt scores a deflected effort over Szczesny, similar to Louis Saha's in the 5-2 match with Spurs. #AFC being embarrased here. 1-2. 
 Champions League football is in the balance for #AFC. The players look like qualification has already been secured. Sort it out, Arsenal. 
Half Time: Arsenal 1-2 Norwich - CL qualification on the line. #AFC lucky not to have goalscorer Benayoun sent off & concede 2 pens. Poor.
There are over 19 million results on Google for the search term 'arsenal poor defending'. Enough said.
#AFC finally starting to show some attacking intent with quickfire RvP and Vermaelen chances. Less than 25 minutes to go.
Robin van Persie equalises for #AFC. Where would be without the Dutchman? Probably 7th or 8th in the League. Now for the winner.
The BEST striker in WORLD football makes it 3-2. He scores when he wants. He wins games when he wants. Outstanding #AFC comeback.
Morrison deflates the #AFC players with a late strike. Another error from Thomas Vermaelen. Less than 5 minutes to go. 3-3.
#AFC now relying on Aston Villa & Manchester City for massive favours tomorrow. Have a feeling third place will be decided on last day.
Norwich scored three goals from just four shots on target against Arsenal. Terrible. (via @Orbinho)
 Alex Song didn't wave or applaud the fans during the #AFC's Lap of Appreciation. Looked 'angry and v upset', according to @Jimmy_Chilides.

 @dappergooner @talksport Agreed. He's settled in his role at Ajax, though. Have a feeling we'll see him at #AFC in near future. 
 Stewart Robson on @talkSPORT:   Arsenal could win the Premier League and the Champions League if they sorted their defence out.   
Looking forward to watching Yann M'Vila in action for Rennes against Montpellier. #AFC have held 'formal discussions' over the 21-year-old.
@markshark10 There are very few 'reliable' sources of #AFC news on Twitter. Lots of guess work involved from certain accounts. Risky.
@abarta115 Grimandi's been to watch him a couple of times. Montpellier's skipper has also caught #AFC's eyes.
 Yann M'Vila to #AFC? No bid agreed. No personal terms agreed. Only tentative enquiries made, as confirmed by myself & @YoungGunsBlog. 
#MCFC want Moroccan forward Younes Belhanda if they fail to land Eden Hazard this summer (Daily Mail). #AFC watched Belhanda last week.
 Any potential move for M'Vila would rely on #AFC qualifying for the Champions League. Hence, nothing has been agreed. 
 Yann M'Vila to #AFC is on, according to French journo @LaurensJulien. Rumoured club record fee. Full credit to @YouAreMyArsenal if true.

 Arsene Wenger on FIFA Interactive World Cup:   I don’t play regularly but I know the FIWC well since many of my Arsenal players enjoy it.

Farewell Pat Rice. 44-years of service from an Arsenal legend. Let's make his last game one to remember.
It's going to be one of those amazing last days. The superb @YossiBenayoun15 capitalises on Fulop's goalkeeping error. #AFC back in third.
Poor goal for #AFC to concede. AW thinks it's offside and so do I. Long makes it 1-1.
Self capitulation from an nervy #AFC defensive unit. Dorrans with the goal. Third place looks a long way off now. 1-2.
Great goal gays! @Andre_Santos27 equalises for #AFC. All square at the Hawthorns. What a game.
AW showing some passion on the touchline. Clenching his fists and punching the air. This game is massive. Come on Arsenal.
Half Time: #WBA 2-2 #AFC - As it stands third place belongs to #THFC. Some terrible first half defending from #AFC. Next 45 mins crucial.
Jenkinson easily turned by the average Fortune. Poor defending from him. #AFC missing @Sagnaofficial's presence at the back.
Laurent Koscielny pats the Arsenal badge. He's a Gooner. He's made it 3-2. Massive goal. Third place back to the good side of north London.
 Jermain Defoe almost certainly secures three points for Tottenham. As it stands, #AFC are in third and #THFC fourth. 
Just seen Armand Traore's superb run and cross for QPR's goal. Superb stuff from the former Arsenal man. Nice guy & promising footballer.
Gervinho finally replaced by Gibbs for #AFC. He's shown inconsistency in his end product throughout the season. Needs a good pre-season.
Five minutes of Harry Redknapp time? If #AFC hold on third place is ours. Crucial final minutes.
Kieran Gibbs may have just saved Champions League football for Arsenal there. One of the best challenges I've seen from him.

Nasri isn't the first #AFC player to have been tapped up and won't be the last. Sad indictment of a game in which money trumps loyalty.

Besiktas have opened negotiations with Arsenal over the possible permanent transfer of midfielder Oguzhan Ozyakup.
 Reports in Turkey suggest that Arsenal will receive €700,000 for Ozyakup. A 25% sell on clause also included in the deal. Good luck to him. 
 Szczesny on Lewandowski:   He could play in any club, any league. I’d like to see him in Arsenal, but I’m just a keeper, not the manager.   
Arsenal still have to pay Werder Bremen €1m as part of the Per Mertesacker deal. Kudos to @simonafc.
Ozyakup to Besiktas very close. Good deal financially for #AFC. Promising player who has the potential to do big things in Turkey.
Arsenal will face Greek champions Olympiacos instead of Anderlecht in their NextGen group next season. Great stuff.
 Oğuzhan Özyakup is undergoing a medical in Turkey ahead of his move to Besiktas. #AFC will receive €700,000 plus 25% sell-on fee. 
 Carlos Vela's agent:   He's had a great time at Real Sociedad and would be happy to stay. We're negotiating [with #AFC] but no update yet.   
 #AFC have received a £8m bid for Djourou, but are hoping another European club will stump up more cash for him. He's in demand.

Olivier Giroud deal close as I tweeted a few days ago. £12m fee being touted for the French striker. Another exciting acquisition from #AFC.
Johan Djourou's agent is still in Italy talking with potential suitors. £8m bid already made. A centre back should be #AFC's next target.

Arsenal confident of extending Alex Song's contract ://tinyurl.com/7ft5lyj 
@rosssaanderson @ibycu2187 Check the video at the end of the article. That's why he's such an asset for #AFC.
An Arsenal XI travel to Boreham Wood on Saturday for their annual pre-season friendly. Youngsters from Memorial Cup squad will be involved.
Great to see commitment from Laurent Koscielny by signing a new long-term deal at #AFC. Fully deserved. Alex Song expected to extend next.
Arsenal arrive in Beijing later this morning ahead of Friday's glamour pre-season clash against #MCFC. Should be a cracking game.
 Thierry Henry:   Eventually I would like to go back to Arsenal. Coaching does interest me. I don’t know what I would do. But I'll go back.   
 Wenger latest on RvP:   The options are clear - we want to keep our players. I'd be happy for him to stay in the Premier League - at #AFC.   
#AFC target Santi Cazorla arrived at Malaga's training ground earlier this morning with agent. Meeting expected soon. pic.twitter.com/8ckIrQZK
Arsenal confirm 2012/13 squad numbers except Lukas Podolski's. Looks like he's waiting on RvP's no.10 shirt. Giroud gets no.12.
 Theo Walcott drew a cartoon for a charity gala dinner in Beijing, China which he named 'Love Football, Love Arsenal.' Very classy. 
 Arsenal chairman Hill-Wood on RvP:   If he is determined to leave that is up to him, but giving him away is not on our agenda.   
 Hill-Wood:   But I thought Robin was happy at Arsenal, especially after the season he had with us.   
Besiktas say they have not made an approach to sign Arsenal striker Marouane Chamakh. The Moroccan wants to stay at #AFC.
 Malaga boss on Cazorla to #AFC:   Selling him for 20million euros is to gift him away, I don't think the club has the intention to do it.

 Koscielny:   Barcelona contacted my agent, but I wanted to stay at Arsenal.   #KosIsAGooner 
 Juve boss:   RvP is a great player and #AFC don't want to lose him. You can't negotiate for a player if they don't want to part with him.   
 Reports in Spain suggest Nuri Sahin is heading to #AFC on loan. They've agreed to lend him to   big   PL club. That rules Spurs out then. 
 Arsenal XI v #MCFC: Fabianski (GK), Jenkinson, Bartley, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Song, Arteta, Diaby, Santos, Walcott, Gervinho. 
@dimitrisvergos They've changed their story in the past 10 minutes from 'Arsenal' to 'big club'. Strange.
 Manchester City field strong starting XI against #AFC in Beijing, with the likes Kompany, Tevez, Aguero and the Toure brothers' all playing. 
Arsenal players have their names on back of their shirts in Chinese. Sponsor's name also. Vermaelen captains the side.
Zabaleta opens the scoring in Beijing. #AFC have had the better chances but #MCFC clinical there. Less than 5 mins to HT. 0-1.
Too easy for #MCFC. Best player on the pitch Yaya Toure taps it in after good work from Kolarov. Terrible end to first half for #AFC. 0-2.
Full Time: #afc 0-2 #mcfc - Scoreline certainly doesn't reflect the game. #AFC with great attacking intent. #MCFC more clinical. Good match.

 Welcome to Arsenal Football Club, Santi Cazorla! 
Arsenal 'highly unlikely' to make an approach for Olympiacos striker Kevin Mirallas even if RvP leaves.
@zkhan90 I'm in Athens right now. Rumours are unfounded and untrue. No interest from #AFC.
@zkhan90 Mirallas? I'd put money on it not happening. He's far from Arsenal quality.
Delighted with #AFC's summer signings so far. All internationals with star quality. @Detective82 article coming in next few days.
 Arsenal Football Club is bigger than one player. Cazorla, Podolski & co can help lead the team back to glory days this season. Believe. 
 Thomas Vermaelen should get the captaincy. Spirited, hard-working fighter who bleeds #AFC. Recently said he wants to stay 'forever'. 
@LadGooner The article said #AFC were 'hopeful' of him signing a new deal. Wage demands increased & agent offering him around.
Arsenal's changed team chemistry: Red Detective's view - ://tinyurl.com/95l2roh 
Arsenal expect to receive around £15m for #FCB-bound Alex Song. He signed from Bastia for a £1m fee 7 years ago. Another excellent AW find.
Sahin next in the pipeline for #AFC. Several outgoings expected also as AW continues his clear out of the 'bad attitudes' and 'deadwood'.
 Yanga-Mbiwa:   You can't say no to AC Milan or Arsenal. I don't know if a deal can be sorted. For now, I'm a Montpellier player.   
 Giroud on #AFC's title chances:   Honestly, it will be complicated. Because the competition is fierce. But who knows?   
 Arsenal XI v #SCFC: Mannone (GK), Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen (c), Gibbs, Arteta, Diaby, Cazorla, Gervinho, Podolski, Giroud. 
 Arsenal subs v #SCFC: Martinez (GK), Santos, Djourou, Coquelin, Ramsey, Walcott, Oxlade-Chamberlain. 
Marouane Chamakh not in the #AFC squad today. Reports in France suggest he's close to joining Malaga on loan. More news expected soon.
Every team in the Premier League must now have the same size pitch. Certainly could affect Stoke's compact-playing style. Come on #AFC!

Jonathan Walters smashes in Peter Crouch's knock-down but it's ruled out for offside. Ironic cheers from the #AFC fans. 0-0.
 Sublime build-up play from #AFC there. Diaby, Cazorla and Podolski all involved. Good match so far. 21 minutes gone. 0-0. 
Half Time: Stoke City 0-0 Arsenal - Dominate in possession. Penalty shout denied. Podolski hard-working and impressive. Cazorla also good.
Arsenal's two English speedsters are on; Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain replace Gervinho & Podolski. Good decision from AW.
Almost a terrific goal from Olivier Giroud on his first start for #AFC. Lobbed effort. Could have played in Ramsey but didn't see him.
FT: #SCFC 0-0 #AFC - No goals in two PL games so far. Giroud almost netted debut goal towards end. Defensively astute performance.
 Bendtner, Chamakh closing in on Arsenal exits - ://tinyurl.com/8c9nx4h

@athlon29 We had an Arsenal official in Germany earlier in the week. No idea if who he was scouting. We could easily afford K.Pap.
Henri Lansbury to #NFFC deal is worth £1m. #AFC recieve another £1m if Forest achieve promotion to Premier League within next two seasons.
Sean O'Driscoll big admirer of the England Under-21 midfielder. Lansbury likely to be earning more than he was at #AFC. Good move for him.
Benik Afobe opens his goalscoring account for Bolton in the League Cup. Great stuff from him. Future star at #AFC.

Chamakh to Malaga loan move very close. Depended on whether they qualified for CL. #AFC subsidising his wages heavily. No future fee agreed.

HT: #thfc 0-1 #afc - Rosicky's early rocket goal separates the two sides. Spurs dominant in possession. Arsenal with the clear-cut chances.
Full Time: Tottenham 0-1 Arsenal - Gutsy defensive performance from Wenger's men. Koscielny an absolute stalwart at the back. Crucial win.
Wojciech Szczesny has just taken a selfie of himself and the Arsenal players celebrating with the away fans at White Hart Lane. Brilliant.

 Arsenal starlets Julio Pleguezuelo, Hector Bellerin & Jon Toral are all playing against their former club today. #UEFAYouthLeague #Barcelona 
 Szczesny on his new contract:   Arsenal do not want to 'overpay'. We met in a place where I was happy, and the club could afford to pay.   
Arsenal press the self destruct button and concede a second. Schurrle with the strike this time. Possession lost in midfield again. Poor.
 Kieran Gibbs has walked off the pitch instead of Chamberlain. Arsenal down to 10 men, but the wrong guy has been sent off. Farcical. 
Perhaps Gibbs going off instead of Chamberlain is a blessing in disguise of sorts. A torrid first 15 minutes from the left-back & #afc.
 Arsenal's away supporters singing 'it's so quiet at the bridge'. Chelsea 3-0 up and have a man advantage, but little noise from their fans. 
Half Time: Chelsea 4-0 Arsenal - 1000th game for AW certainly isn't going to plan. Gibbs sent off after 15. Midfield & defence non-existent.
Full Time: Chelsea 6-0 Arsenal - Giroud should have scored early on. Simple misplaced passes led to many of the goals. Appalling display.
 Mourinho:   AW said before the game that this was Arsenal's biggest game of the season. We don't say that, but it's still important for us.
