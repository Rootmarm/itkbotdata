
Arsenal thought to be in for Chris Smalling from Fulham. Man United also keen though.
Stefan Savic completing a trial at Arsenal today. Wenger is keen but have you heard of him?!
Arsenal are basically playing in Hull's penalty area but not actually shooting. Still the best part of ten minutes to find a way through.
Full time 2-1. Vital win that puts Arsenal second at least until Man United play Fulham tomorrow.
Post match interviews then over the Humber Bridge and back down south. Next Arsenal game - West Ham at home 20th March.
Diaby on Arsenal facing 'disgraceful' physical approach from other Premier League teams in today's Standard
"Arsenal to play Barcelona, Man United v Bayern. Latest column ( alittle late) below."
"Wenger wont be happy Arsenal are at home first. Club secretary David Miles ""Its not the draw we would have wanted...but we owe Barca one."""
Early goal from Denilson- a lovely finish by the way- has settled arsenal into a good rhythm.
"Franco off, Cole on for West Ham. Diaby on for Bendtner for Arsenal."
Arshavin playing through the middle on his own for Arsenal. Tense atmosphere here now. Cole up top with Mido.
"Arsenal have more of a footing in the game now and seemed to have quietened the Hammers. For now, at least."
A shade over 24 minutes remaining at the Emirates. Arsenal look more likely to score. Mark Noble about to come on.
"Incidentally, I believe Vermaelen's sending off is Arsenal first red card of the Premier League season. Noble on for Kovac."
Penalty to Arsenal
Upson handled Fabregas's chipped pass through. No second yellow so he stays on. Fabregas to take pen and surely put Arsenal top of the PL.
Hugely spirited display this from Arsenal - have overcome the odds again. West Ham have been poor though against ten men.
The penalty was very similar to the late one Arsenal got at Stoke a few weeks back. Chipped up onto Upson's hand.
2-0 Full time. Arsenal go top with Man United playing Liverpool and Blackburn hosting Chelsea tomorrow.
"All in all, a decent weekend for Arsenal. They stay about Chelsea after their draw at Blackburn. Roll on Birmingham."
Away fans bowing before him. Eight goals in a week for Messi - effortless finish. Arsenal have been warned.
No decision expected on Vermaelen's red card appeal until this afternoon. Arsenal have until 1pm to submit their evidence.
Spoke to Wenger this morning who insists Arsenal won't break their contract principles to keep Gallas at the club.
Read an exclusive interview with Gael Clichy on Arsenal's first return to Birmingham since Eduardo's injury in tomorrow's Standard.
Just received my player access sticker from the fabulous Arsenal press officer who is absolutely not reading this over my shoulder. #Arsenal
"Apparently I need to add #Arsenal to every tweet so people can find me. Personally, I find it a little annoying."
Campbell heads over from Fabregas's corner. Arsenal enjoying a bit more of the ball now.
Not really seen enough from Arsenal in the opening period. How long before Arshavin and Nasri come on? Fabregas still looks shaken.
Rosicky fires miles over. Surely its time for the cavalry now. Was that miss the little bit of luck Arsenal needed?
Arsenal just starting to crank it up a little here. Free-kick for foul on Rosicky.
8 minutes plus stoppages for Arsenal to hold on. Kevin Phillips is coming on for Fahey.
"Nasri in, tried to square it rather than shoot (classic Arsenal). Ball hacked clear."
Arsenal plrobably didnt do enough on balance to win the game but to drop two points like that is a sickener.
At Arsenal training ground and Cesc is not training with the rest of the squad. Must be a major doubt for tomorrow now.
Fabregas starts for Arsenal - Wenger is going to risk him it would appear.
Arsenal at full strength (side from RVP) - only time will tell how big a gamble it is to play Gallas and Fabregas.
Barca dominating the ball early on - Arsenal look set to play on the counter attack.
Arsenal cannot get a foothold in the game and they are very lucky not to be behind already.
All hands to the pump for Arsenal - quite incredible how they are not behind. Could easily be 4-0 down. Crowd are both agitated and scared.
#Arsenal warming to the task. Nasri shoots just wide. 23 minutes before their first shot on goal. #Barcelona
"Eboue finally comes on, Arshavin off straight down the tunnel. Messi goes over in the box under Clichy's tackle. Nothing doing. #Arsenal"
"Barca are a touch less dominant, only a touch, but Arsenal simply cannot hold onto the ball for long enough to create anything meaningful."
"Gallas off on stretcher, Arsenal playing with ten temporarily."
"The goal has stirred Arsenal into life a little but the more they committ, the more Barca can break. We're set up for an enthralling end."
Arsenal need a miracle now. The Emirates is decidedly subdued.
Barca playing with total authority now. Walcott about to come on for Arsenal 24 minutes left.
"Pique upends Fabregas on edge of the box. The Barca defender is out of the second leg, dangerous position for #Arsenal."
Over the bar. But much better from Arsenal generally - 17 minutes to go.
"Penalty to Arsenal, red card for Puyol"
Very fortunate for Arsenal.
He is going to have to go off. Arsenal playing with ten. Milito on for Messi.
2-2 full time. Will feel like a victory for Arsenal. Somehow they are still in the tie.
Chelsea get a vital win at United. Great news for Arsenal too. Beat Wolves and its game on again...
Bendtner pulls it out at the death for Arsenal! 1-0 full time. The title is still on. Roll on Tuesday.
I will be giving live updates tonight from the Nou Camp so look out for that from around 7pm. #Arsenal #Barcelona
Arsenal fans are up in the gods. Insanely high up there. The Camp Nou pitch is sunk below ground level but no-one can tell me how far.
"Reasonable start this from Arsenal, considering. They havent had much of the ball but Barca have not really opened them up. Yet."
Bendtner 0-1 Arsenal!!!!!!!!!!
It is a breathtaking sight to watch Messi run down that Barca right flank. Seems an inevitability about it but Arsenal survived.
3-1 Messi. He breaks the offside trap and dinks a stunning finish over Almunia. He's unstoppable and you fear for Arsenal now.
"A goal now would make it interesting. Remember, 3-3 would send Arsenal through."
"Eboue on for Silvestre, who has had a miserable night and there is virtually no reception from the Arsenal fans up in the gods."
Nice turn from Pedro but he drags his right foot show wide. 10 minutes + added time left for Arsenal to save their Champions League season.
So Arsenal are out of Europe for another yeat. No disgrace losing to this lot but the inquest over the depth of the squad will begin.
Read Manuel Almunia's thoughts on #Arsenal's Champions League exit to Barcelona first in Wednesday's London Evening Standard.
Chelsea go 4 points clear at top of PL with 1-0 win. Arsenal can reduce it to 3 if they beat Spurs tmw. You feel they simply have to now.
Arsenal team exactly as in todays Standard. I like it when that happens.
"OK. In position at WHL. Arsenal: Almunia, Sagna, Campbell, Vermaelen, Clichy; Nasri, Diaby, Denilson, Eboue, Bendtner, Rosicky."
"Van Persie, Walcott and Eduardo among the subs for #arsenal, Bentley, Crouch and Gudjohnsen for #Tottenham"
Atmosphere building nicely at WHL. Arsenal players jeered at every touch in the warm uo.
Sol effort at goal from a corner stopped by Assou-Ekotto on the line. What a silencer that would have been for #Arsenal
"Bendtner drags a left foot half chance wide from just inside box. 27 mins gone, Arsenal created very little but are getting more of the ball"
Spurs playing on the break now as Arsenal monoplise the ball. Modric booked for foul on Sagna.
"Modric is in, momentarily, but Clichy and then Almunia do enough to snuff out the threat #Arsenal"
We're back underway with #Spurs leading #Arsenal 1-0. Massive 45 minutes in both clubs' seasons coming up.
"Defoe's pass finds Bale, who looks offside but Sagna is playing him on, and he sidefoots past Almunia. A mountain to climb now for #Arsenal"
"And its Sagna. Walcott on, Eboue switches to right-back. We have played 51 minutes and its #Spurs 2-0 #Arsenal"
Away fans are chanting RVP's name. They want the Dutchman on - big ask to salvage this for #Arsenal after five months out.
Vermaelen has taken a seat in the Arsenal dugout. He looks angry more than upset. Didnt limp either.
Fantastic volley from RVP brings an equally fantastic one-handed stop from Gomes. Rosicky's shot is deflected wide. #Arsenal getting closer.
Dangerous free-kick on edge of the box for Arsenal. Dawson is booked for clipping Diaby. RVP to take...
Its like they bhave won the League here. 11 years since they last beat #Arsenal.
So #Spurs close within one point of #ManCity in fourth while #Arsenal stay 6 points behind #Chelsea.
You have to say that is probably Arsenal's title bid over. But then #Chelsea won't fancy coming here after that so you never know...
Read Danny Rose and Heurelho Gomes's thoughts on #Spurs 2-1 win over #Arsenal in today's #London Evening #Standard.
Big chance for #Arsenal to close the gap at #Wigan tomorrow after Chelsea's loss. My train gets in at 12.30 so expect updates from 1pm.
"#Arsenal: Fabianski; Sagna, Campbell, Vermaelen, Clichy; Nasri, Eastmond, Diaby; Walcott, Bendtner, Rosicky."
"#Wigan are lined up 4-2-3-1 with Moreno supported by N'Zogbia, Watson and #Rodallega, #Arsenal their customary 4-3-3."
"Quiet start. #Campbell, captaining the side for the first time since returning to #Arsenal, has already made two decent interceptions."
"Arsenal free-kick on the edge of the box after a foul on #Walcott. Clichy and Nasri lining it up, left of centre, 25 yards out."
Diame is caught in possession by Diaby and he hauls back the Arsenal midfielder to earn the first yellow card. The locals are unimpressed.
#Arsenal showing signs of finding some sort of rhythm. Better possession now and Rosicky warms #Kirkland's hands from 20 yards out.
Yep SIlvestre doubles Arsenal's lead with three minutes of the second half gone. You have to think thats game over now.
#Wigan have never beaten #Arsenal in the #PremierLeague and that doesn't look like changing today. No confidence at all in the final third.
There seems to be some furore about a Wigan penalty appeal before Arsenal got their 2nd. Nasri pulled back Watson but went down very easily.
#Wigan get in down the left and the ball is cut back to Watson who sidefoots home from 12 yards out. #Arsenal were carved open there.
That may just stir #Arsenal into life as it has been a dismal second half as a spectacle.
#Wenger will probably tear his own face off if #Arsenal somehow contrive to throw this away.
Merida and Eboue have come on for Rosicky and Walcott. Surely #Arsenal just need to keep the ball now and run down the clock?!
Watson's header is cleared off the line!!! I think it was Sagna. Its mayhem in the Arsenal box now. Another Wigan corner.
Arsenal have gone to pieces. The DW Stadium is rocking. I clearly know nothing about this game - who could have seen this coming?
Wigan's first ever PL win over Arsenal is confirmed. Full-time.
"I will now attempt to speak to an #Arsenal player. Yeah, I dont hold out much hope."
#Clichy tells today's #LondonEveningStandard he is happy at #Arsenal despite reports linking #Barcelona with a £10m summer bid.
Spoken to #Wenger today - and he warned #Adebayor that #Arsenal are the club that made him but forgives him for his celebration in September
Another late show from #ManUnited. Pressure on #Chelsea now - live updates from #Arsenal v #ManCity from 5pm.
"We're underway. Arsenal: Fabianski, Sagna, Sol, Silvestre, Clichy, Song, Nasri, Diaby, Walcott, Van Persie, Rosicky."
"Ten gone, scrappy and disjointed from both. #Arsenal with more of the ball but nothing created of note at either end yet."
#City look happy to take a 0-0 home with them and are committing few men forward. #Arsenal still look shellshocked from #Wigan.
#Arsenal just havent looked like breaking City down. #Bellamy is booked for crunching tackle on #Bendtner.
"Relatively speaking in a very quiet game, Arsenal are mounting a little concerted pressure here. RVP to deliver another fk from out wide"
"Cleared but Arsenal keep the ball, RVP twists and turns in the box but can find no space. #City scramble it clear again."
"At the risk of tempting fate, I think we could have another 88 minutes here and not see a goal. Arsenal fans starting to file out."
"Full time 0-0. Dire game, 2nd half marginally better than the first. That mathematically ends #Arsenal's title bid, City 1pt behind #Spurs."
"#Arsenal confirm #ACMilan, #Lyon and #Celtic all to play at Emirates Cup in last weekend of July."
Arrived at #Emirates for #Wenger press conference. Very low media turnout - dead game for #Arsenal. Everyone must be gearing up for #Fulham.
"Could be 4-4-2, not played that way for ages though. #Walcott and #VanPersie up front for #Arsenal? Maybe not. Pies in the press room."
Notable for #Arsenal fans this - #Johan #Djourou on the bench since a knee cartilage injury suffered in August.
Pretty chilly up here in the stands. Teams are out warming up. #Blackburn perhaps slightly more vigorously than #Arsenal.
Women's FA Cup Final 2-2 between #Arsenal and #Everton - apparently only one journalist turned up to the pre-match Arsenal presser on Thurs.
The mascots scamper off as the teams come out. Looks like #VanPersie has the armband for #Arsenal. We'll be underway imminently.
"Corner flicked on by Diaby and Van Persie escapes Givet to score a header, yes a header, with 14 minutes played. 1-0 #Arsenal."
"If #Blackburn hang onto this result, they will go 10th in the Premier League. And #Spurs could still catch #Arsenal for 3rd..."
"2 mins plus stoppages left for #Arsenal to salvage anything. It doesnt look that likely at the moment, I have to say. Attendance: 26,138"
Full time 2-1 Blackburn. #Arsenal's players trudge off the pitch. Let the wave of #Fabianski abuse begin. I wonder if he will want to talk..
If you are wondering why #Wenger has not spoken today - he has a sore throat apparently so no #Arsenal press conference today
"Seems a bit weak if you ask me. Why Pat Rice couldn't do it, or for that matter an #Arsenal player, is beyond me. Poor way to end the season"
"Arsenal: Fabianski, Sagna, Campbell, Silvestre, Clichy; Eboue, Diaby, Nasri; Walcott, Van Persie (c), Arshavin."
"So, #Arsenal win and they guarantee 3rd but a defeat would let #Tottenham in if they beat #Burnley. Surely it can't happen?!?!"
"A few ironic cheers ring out from the home fans as #Fabianski claims a cross. Bad form, that, from the #Arsenal fans."
Arshavin 1-0 Arsenal
3-0 Arsenal own goal (Baird). The defender turns in #Walcott's cross after #Eboue fails with a backflick.  Comically bad.
3-0 to Arsenal at half-time. Easy as you like. Its a question of how many they want in the second half.
"#Fulham fans singing ""we're going to Germany"" and the #Arsenal fans applaud them. Nice - the Fabianski baiting has stopped too."
#Djourou comes on for #Arsenal to warm applause. His first appearance of the season. Silvestre goes off - could be his last for the club.
Arsenal 4-0 (Vela). Delightful little flick over Schwarzer after being put in by Nasri. Lovely finish.
#Arsenal players are coming back out for a lap of appreciation...
Read #RobinvanPersie's thoughts on #Arsenal's season first in tomorrow's #LondonEveningStandard
Fran #Merida leaves #Arsenal and returns to #Atletico Madrid. Not a great surprise that but another minor blow to #Wenger.
#Arsenal thought to have made a £4m offer for #Lorient centre-back Laurent #Koscielny. Club are holding out for £7m though.
#Barca make formal offer to #Arsenal for #Fabregas. Likely to be rejected as its only an opening negotating position.
#Fabregas offer understood to be £30m and set to be rejected by #Arsenal...
#Arsenal set to step up interest in #Koscielny. My money would be on him joining the #Gunners by the end of the #worldcup
#Koscielny thought to have nearly agreed personal terms over #Arsenal move - clubs haggling over the fee but almost a done deal.
#Lorient set to sign defender Bruno Manga paving the way for Arsenal to land #Koscielny. Deal to go through this week once price agreed.
As I said earlier in week (bit of shameless self-promotion) #Arsenal complete signing of #Koscielny for total fee of £10m. Should wear No6.
I'd be surprised if Shaun Wright-Phillips ends up at #Arsenal as reported this morning. They don't need him and would be end of Theo.
"Looks like #Almunia's time at #Arsenal could be up. #Wenger: ""He gets nervous on big matches, thereby making silly mistakes."" See ya, Manuel"
"Some controversy over #Wenger interview with Kenyan paper I mentioned earlier. #Arsenal says quotes are inaccurate, Kenyans say its legit."
Reports in #esp suggest #Barcelona have set Friday deadline to reach agreement with #Arsenal over #Fabregas. Gunners holding out for £50m+.
#Eduardo agrees £6m move to #Shakhtar after assurances from #Croatia coach #Bilic his international career wouldn't be affected. #arsenal
#VanPersie to wear No10 at #Arsenal this season. He'll love that - following in the footsteps of his idol #Bergkamp.
#Wenger confident #Campbell will stay at #Arsenal for one more season - hasn't bought another centre-back yet for that reason.
#Eduardo issues personal messgae to #Arsenal fans - #Wenger says he won't sign a replacement striker.
Reports in #esp suggest #Fabregas has agreed personal terms over move to #Barcelona. #Arsenal may well have something to say about that...
#Sol Campbell reportedly having a medical at #Newcastle - would be quite a u-turn as he indicated to #Arsenal he would stay.
#Djourou went off injured in #Arsenal's friendly win last night but should be fit for Emirates Cup. #Bendner to miss start of season though.
Sources in Spain suggesting #Fabregas will tell #Wenger again this weekend that he wants to leave #Arsenal and join #Barcelona...
"At the #Emirates where #Arsenal and #Celtic are about to kick-off. Cloudy but mild day, sell-out in the stands and Queen on the PA system..."
#Vela slides the ball home after Walcott's scuffed centre. Awful defending from #Celtic and #Arsenal lead 1-0 here after 3 minutes.
#Celtic fans refusing to join the Mexican wave that is currently doing the rounds here. #Arsenal lead 1-0. Game is just ticking along.
"Arsenal 2-0 Celtic. Low left foot drive from Sagna, of all people, takes a slight deflection but goes straight through Zaluska in goal. H-T."
Walcott slips a pass to Nasri who sidefoots it home from 16 yards. 3-0 Arsenal. Could be a cricket score this. Depends how bothered they are
"Arsenal 3-1 Celtic. Pinball in the #Arsenal penalty area and it falls to Murphy, who smashes it home."
#Arsenal 3-2 #Celtic. #Fortune crossed for Ki #Sung-Yeung to slot the ball home. Impressive response this from Celtic. 7 mins left.
#Arsenal win 3-2 and retain #Emirates Cup. Insert your own joke about trophy drought here.

#Chamakh desperate to get one over on Chelsea - in today's #LondonEveningStandard. #arsenal
#Barcelona urged to call #Wenger's bluff over #Arsenal's refusal to sell #Fabregas in today's #LondonEveningStandard.
"In #Arsenal news, #Wenger failed to turn up for a charity event today because he was ""in a meeting"". With Cesc perhaps? Or a centre-back?"
"#Fabregas statement expected some time this afternoon, although #Arsenal insist it is not a foregone conclusion there will be one."
#Fabregas statement out - he'll stay put for now but could have been more forthcoming in his love for #Arsenal. #Barcelona next summer?
#Wenger seems set to sign new deal at #Arsenal. Probably confirmed during the international break next month.
"#Arsenal; #Sagna, #Vermaelen, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Nasri, #Diaby, #Wilshere, #Eboue, #Chamakh, #Arshavin (#Van Persie, #Walcott on bench)."
"#Arsenal far more composed in possession but creating little really. But then neither have #Liverpool. Could do with a goal, this."
Joe Cole sent off! Went in late on #Koscielny. Its a bad one but a straight red looks a touch harsh. Stretcher for the #Arsenal lad though
"#Anfield is rocking now as #Arsenal, despite having an extra man, are on the back foot. A succession of corners. They need to survive this."
#Rosicky's cross is headed wide by #Vermaelen. Difficult chance but #Arsenal have struggled to create anything clear cut.
"What's that? You have a big striker to come back in? Well, so do #Arsenal. #Van Persie is on for #Diaby as #Wenger goes for broke."
#Rosicky is only denied an equaliser by a stunning save from #Reina - super football and easily the best chance #Arsenal have created.
"1-1. #Arsenal are level. Comical own goal. Chamakh's header comes back off the post and #Reina, trying to catch it, fumbles it into the net."
Liverpool 1-1 Arsenal. Breathless second half and #Arsenal deserved a point for possession but #Reina gifted it. Two debutants sent off too.
#Nasri will be out for a month after undergoing knee surgery on an meniscal injury sustained during Sunday's draw with #Liverpool. #arsenal
#Fulham thought to be holding out for £4million for #Schwarzer. #Wenger won't pay that but #Arsenal have 12 days to negotiate.
Sebastien #Squillachi to undergo medical at #Arsenal on Monday ahead of move from Sevilla.
"#Redknapp says #Gallas signing is #Tottenham getting ""one over"" on #Arsenal. Also says #Spurs unlikely to sign another player this summer."
"#Arsenal drawn to face #Shakhtar #Donetsk, #Braga and #FK Partisan - looks a good draw to me."
Just got to Grove after #eng training. Arsenal young keeper James Shea in to make up numbers as Carson (back) and Foster (knee) are out.
#Arsenal thought to have made final offer for #Schwarzer. Up to #Fulham now - #Wenger relaxed - at #eng training talking to #Baldini.
#VanPersie out until mid-October. Big blow for #Arsenal. And for my fantasy football team.
Rumours #Walcott is out for up to six weeks after scan revealed ankle ligament damage. #Arsenal yet to confirm.
#Arsenal confirm #Walcott out for four to six weeks with ankle injury.
#Vermaelen out of #Arsenal's game against Bolton with an Achilles injury. Should be fit for #Braga.
#Arsenal lead 1-0. Penalty. #Chamakh brought down and #Fabregas slots it home. Easy as you like.
Sumptuous start from #Arsenal. Carving the visitors open at will. Second goal required but this is comfortable at present.
"#Arsenal 3-0 #Braga. #Chamakh finishes well from #Wilshere's flick. Could be a cricket score. Not one that's fixed, though (allegedly)."
#Arsenal 4-0 #Braga. They pick up where they left off. 53 minutes played #Arshavin crosses to #Fabregas who heads home. Easy.
"#Arsenal 5-0 #Braga. Delightful, delightful stuff. #Arshavin feeds the ball into #Vela who chips it over #Felipe. Wonderful."
"#Arsenal 6-0 #Braga. #Fabregas, who has been superb, plays in #Vela who wrongfoots the keeper and rolls the ball inside the near post."
"#Redknapp confirms #Pletikosa, #Bassong, #Palacios will all start for #Spurs against #Arsenal tomorrow. #Bentley, #Keane, #Hutton likely too"
"Stronger that expected #Arsenal team as #Rosicky, #Eboue, #Koscielny and #Wilshere start. #Pavlyuchenko and #Giovani for #Spurs."
"#Tottenham 0-1 #Arsenal. #Wilshere crosses and the home defence is static, allowing #Lansbury to slide in for his first senior goal."
Half time and its 1-0 #Arsenal. Dominated the half with an impressive display but Spurs are far too narrow and haven't got tactics right.
#Tottenham 1-1#Arsenal. Naughton plays in #Keane who breaks the offside trap to equalise. #Fabianski should do better.
#Arsenal dominate but can't find a winner. We'll have extra time at White Hart Lane. More signalling from Wenger.
#Tottenham 1-2 #Arsenal. Nasri scores from the penalty spot after being brought down by #Bassong. A touch harsh but probably right.
#Tottenham 1-3 #Arsenal. #Nasri scores another penalty after #Chamakh is brought down by #Caulker. He went down easily but contact made.
#Tottenham 1-4 #Arsenal. #arshavin is fouled but gets straight up as spurs switch off and smashes a left foot shot past pletikosa.

"Well, we are underway here but the floodlights are not fully on. Its got a kind of twilight feel to it. #Arsenal in yellow. 4-2-3-1."
#Cleo is in behind the defence but #Arsenal get back in numbers to crowd him out. Incredible atmosphere here now.
"#Squillaci and #Fabianski nearly make a mess of a routine clearance. At the other end, signs #Arsenal are easing into the game, slowly."
#Partizan 0-1 #Arsenal. #Arshavin gives the visitors the lead with a low drilled shot from just inside the area. Home fans seem oblivious.
"#Arshavin, #Rosicky and #Arshavin all have golden chances to make it 2-0. Free kick from Denilson hits wall. All #Arsenal now."
#Partizan 1-1 #Arsenal. #Denilson is adjudged to have handled in the box and #Cleo easily beats #Fabianski. Game on.
#Arsenal still on top despite the equaliser. The edge has been taken off their play though as #Partizan have renewed hope.
"#Partizan 1-2 #Arsenal. A long cross from the right finds #Chamakh, whose first header is tipped onto the bar, but his second finds the net."

#Chelsea 0-0 #Arsenal. #Arshavin just went close with a rasping drive. Even contest. Visitors giving as good as they get.
"#Chelsea 1-0 #Arsenal. Had to be that man #Drogba, who turns home Cole's cross. #Wenger furious about foul given in the build up."
Back underway at the Bridge. #Arsenal on the front foot and they have to be. Big half for their confidence going forward now.
"Great game now. #Arsenal go close twice before #Squillaci gifts the ball to #Anelka, who rounds Fabianski but puts it wide."
"Emmanuel-Thomas on for Arsenal. Wilshere off, a little surprisingly. Ten mins left. Chamakh misses glorious chance- heads wide."
#Chelsea 2-0 #Arsenal. Koscielny fouls Anelka and Alex smashes the free kick into the top corner. Game over.
Full time. Arsenal fail to answer the same questions yet again. 7 pt gap now.
"#Fabregas also warns #Arsenal need to end their silverware drought soon: ""I have everything at Arsenal, we just need to win titles."""
"Anyway, here at the the San Siro, #Spurs come out for their warm-up. The stadium screen is showing #Arsenal's goals from last night. Ironic."
"Here at #City v #Arsenal- 5 mins in and #Boyata is sent off! Rightly, for a tackle on #Chamakh. He was last man."
Super start - #Arsenal had been under the cosh but that red card has totally changed the game.
Man City 0-1 #Arsenal. Lovely move. #Nasri plays a give and go with #Arshavin and steers the ball high past #Hart. 20 mins gone.
Penalty to Arsenal.
"Man City 0-2 #Arsenal. #Bridge intercepts #Fabregas's pass for #Chamakh but gives it straight to Song, who stabs home."
Man City 0-3 #Arsenal. Substitute #Bendtner opens up his body to curl one past Hart. Game over.

Its >>20 for an adult ticket here at St James' Park tonight for #Newcastle v #Arsenal. Stadium set to be half full though.
Honestly could be 4-1 to #Arsenal already. #Walcott gets behind the defence but his cross is cleared before #Bendtner shoots just wide.
"#Newcastle 0-1 #Arsenal. Stoppage time corner headed goalwards by #Bendtner, it may have gone over the line before rebounding off #Krul."
"#Newcastle 0-2 #Arsenal. And its controversial. #Walcott breaks through but #Bendtner, coming back from offside, blocks off nearest defender"
"#Newcastle giving it a decent go here but yet to muster a clear cut chance. Meanwhile, #Arsenal look dangerous on the break. 2-0, 80 played."
"#Newcastle 0-3 #Arsenal. #Newcastle lose possession and #Fabregas finds #Bendtner, who hit a sweet effort into the top corner. Game over."
#Newcastle 0-4 #Arsenal. #Walcott is played in and he speeds away from the defence and slots unerringly past #Krul. Comprehensive.
"Full-time 4-0 #Arsenal. #Szczesny makes a late save to earn a well deserved clean sheet. He was excellent, as was #Walcott, as were #Arsenal"

"#Arteta looks massively off the pace, it must be said, while #Coleman's early industry has petered out. #Arsenal in relative control."
#Everton 0-2 #Arsenal. Superb goal. #Fabregas plays a one-two with #Chamakh and fires the return into the far corner. Brilliant.
#Everton 1-2 Arsenal. #Saha heads down Pienaar's corner and #Cahill is on hand to turn it home. We're into stoppage time.
#Everton 1-2 #Arsenal. Full time. #Arsenal survive a late barrage to take a derserved victory from Goodison Park.
#Wenger urges #Arsenal fans to respect #Gallas on his return to Emirates tomorrow. Fat chance...
Here at Emirates for #Arsenal v #Spurs. Frenetic start- #Gallas pumped up by captaincy. But then the #Arsenal fans know all about that...
"#Arsenal 1-0 #Tottenham. #Nasri, who has already exchanged unpleasantries with Gallas, beats Gomes to the ball and scores from a tight angle"
#Arsenal 2-0 #Tottenham. Lovely counter attack. Fabregas feeds #Arshavin who crosses for #Chamakh to turn home. #Gallas argues with the ref.
#Bentley gesturing towards the #Arsenal fans as he warms up. He is being provoked but he just can't resist it can he?
Half time. 2-0 #Arsenal. Bit better from Spurs before the break but Arsenal in truth could be out of sight. Gallas Spurs best player.
"#Arsenal 2-1 #Spurs. Long ball is won by #Defoe, VDV picks it up and feeds #Bale, who prods it past Fabianski. Game on."
#Spurs formation switch has freed them up. #Modric fires just over and Arsenal are playing counter attack football on their own ground.
#Arsenal 2-2 #Tottenham. Fabregas idiotically jumps in the wall with his hand in the air. VDV's free kick strikes his hand. Pen. VDV scores.
#Squillaci has the ball in the net but the flag is rightly raised for offside. Fabregas then volleys over. Good response this from #Arsenal.
Crouch on for Pav. He scored for England in midweek. Can he do it again? Walcott imminent for Arsenal.
#Arsenal 2-3 #Tottenham. Oh my. Van der Vaart's free-kick is flicked home by #Kaboul. What a turnaround. 4 mins left.
#Arsenal 2-3 #Tottenham. Its over. First win here for Spurs since 1993. Switch to 4-4-2 the key. Arsenal couldn't handle it.
"Fantastic presser from #Arshavin. ""#Arsenal cannot finish top of the group."" ""Defence isn't good enough- we try to improve but we can't."""
"OK. At #Emirates. Arsenal line up: Fabianski, Sagna, Squillaci, Koscielny, Gibbs, Nasri, Song, Denilson, Arshavin, van Persie, Chamakh"
Plenty of empty seats here at #Arsenal. Van Persie and Chamakh in starting line up but Van Persie playing in hole behind him.
"#Arsenal on top in opening stages but it is like a morgue out here at the moment, Handful of #Partizan fans making more noise."
Penalty to #Arsenal
#Arsenal 1-0 #Partizan. #Van Persie scores from the spot after being brought down in the box. Looked soft but probably the right decision.
#Arsenal 1-1 #Partizan. Oh my. #Gunners defence stands off #Cleo and his shot deflects off #Squillaci and past #Fabianski.
"Delicately poised this. #Arsenal go through as it stands but if #Partizan score again or #Braga score in #Shakhtar (0-0 now), that changes."
"#Arshavin, who was critical of the #Arsenal defence yesterday, has had a shocker and is replaced by #Walcott. 22 mins left."
#Arsenal 2-1 #Partizan. #Walcott chests the ball down and volleys home after Sagna's cross isnt dealt with. They've been poor but now lead.
#Arsenal 3-1 #Partizan. #Song plays a one-two with #Bendtner and finds #Nasri who turns smartly and fires a left-foot shot past #Stojkovic.
#Sagna is sent off! Rightly so for fouling #Lazevski who had got goalside. #Arsenal manage to keep out the resultant free kick.
"Full time. 3-1. Van Persie: ""As a football fan, I would like us to get #Barcelona."" Bet there are a few #Arsenal fans who disagree"

"1-0 United HT. Bit harsh on #Arsenal, who looked more fluid in possession- all too familiar. Can #Wenger come up with the answer this time?"

"#Arsenal pouring forward, #United sitting deep to pick them off on the break. #Nani wastes a great chance after sustained #Arsenal pressure."
5th penalty in last 8 visits here #Arsenal have conceded...
FT 1-0.#United were hanging on a bit at the end. #Arsenal a touch unlucky to lose. Haven't we been here before?
#Arsenal get #Barcelona. It had to be!
Bad news for #Arsenal that on many levels. #Fabregas talk will start again and he may see gulf between sides at close quarters again.
@jamesdalton1980 Tough one to call given Chelsea's bad form at present and Arsenal's inability to keep a clean sheet. I'd say score draw.
Funny story about #Wilshere- had new Audi 4x4 delivered to #Arsenal training ground but been sitting there all week as it is not road taxed!
#Bowyer given three game ban for tackle on #Sagna in #Arsenal.

#Arsenal should be ahead. They play their penalty box passing game and #VanPersie just fails to connect with the goal gaping. Fast start.
"Break in play and #Mancini has chat with #DeJong, who is struggling to cope with #Arsenal's movement. Seems a matter of time for the Gunners"
#Arsenal 0-0 #ManCity HT. Don't know how though. City showing no ambition beyond repelling incessant #Arsenal attacks.
#VanPersie hits one from 25 yards that is arrowing into the top corner but #Hart makes a top class save to deny him. #Arsenal still on top.
#Arsenal 0-0 #ManCity. FT. #Mancini doesn't shake #Wenger's hand and instead walks onto the pitch to argue with the ref and #Fabregas.

"Not to be outdone by #Spurs, #Arsenal have announced #Thierry #Henry will train with the club this month. He was at #ManCity game too."
@_TimMcSweeney Chelsea and Spurs both played yesterday and Arsenal were Saturday. That's the only reason. Lots of Carling Cup stuff to come!
Arrived at #Ipswich. Proper football club. Lovely press room soup. Constant rain plus slick surface should bode well for #Arsenal passing.
"#Arsenal: #Szczesny, #Eboue, #Koscielny, #Djourou, #Gibbs; #Wilshere, #Denilson, #Walcott, #Fabregas, #Arshavin; #Bendtner. Strong side."
#Arsenal need to be careful because they are getting sloppy. #Wickham is a real threat from the left and #Ipswich are battling hard.
"#Arsenal are, frankly, all over the place at the moment. #Priskin is in after a long ball over the top but #Djourou scrambles clear."
#Ipswich 1-0 #Arsenal. They deserve it too. #Priskin is played in by #Healy and he slides it past #Szczesny. A little over 10 mins left.
#Ipswich 1-0 #Arsenal. Full time. Deserved. Should have been more in the end. #Arsenal wilted badly but they have the second leg to recover.
Read #Fabregas on #Arsenal's defeat to #Ipswich first in Thursday's #LondonEveningStandard.
@JamieStell Certainly a raw talent but thought his attitude was excellent and caused #Arsenal problems. Looks the real deal.
Wenger hinted this morning #Almunia and #Arshavin will not leave #Arsenal this month. Will follow up at lunchtime press conference.
Sell out for FA Cup 3rd Rnd Replay #Leeds v #Arsenal tomorrow- their first of the season. Should be great atmosphere- looking forward to it.

"#Leeds 0-2 #Arsenal. #O'Brien clears it to #Sagna, who fires home from 16 yards. Think that's only his 3rd goal for #Arsenal."
"#Leeds 1-2 #Arsenal. My word- pick that out. #Howson lays it off to #Johnson, who hits a screamer from 30 yards into the top corner."
#Leeds 1-3 #Arsenal. That should be that. #VanPersie heads home #Bendtner's cross. Spirited performance from Leeds but class has told.
"#Leeds 1-3 #Arsenal. That should be that. #Bendtner crosses fro #VanPersie, who steers a header, yes a header, past #Schmeichel."

#Arsenal started well but #Ipswich holding their own. Just about. #Sagna has to come off injured to be replaced by #Eboue.
"#Ipswich fans singing '1-0 to the rugby team'. #Fabregas doing everything to drive #Arsenal forward, RVP has hit the bar but no joy yet."
"#Arsenal 1-0 #Ipswich. #Wilshere's diagonal pass finds #Bendtner on the left, he cuts inside before bending a superb curling shot past Fulop"
#Arsenal 2-0 #Ipswich. #Koscielny is totally unmarked to head home #Fabregas' corner. #Arsenal going to Wembley as it stands...
#Arsenal 3-0 #Ipswich. #Fabregas nutmegs Fulop from close range. The Gunners are off to Wembley and #Ipswich's spirit is surely broken.
3-0 FT. So #Arsenal will go to Wembley in the last weekend of February. #Fabregas inspirational but credit to #Ipswich who fought valiantly.
Read #Wilshere's thoughts on #Arsenal reaching the Carling Cup Final in #Wednesday's #LondonEveningStandard.

So #Arsenal sign Japanese striker Ryo #Miyaichi... And Gooners fans thought there would be no big signing...

"#Diaby, #Arshavin and now #Bendtner all on in 2nd half as #Arsenal look to rescue 0-1 scoreline. Had all of the ball but few clear chances."
#Arsenal 1-1 #Everton. Right on cue. #Fabregas lifts it over the Everton defence for #Arshavin to cooly slot past #Howard. Game on.
"#Arsenal 2-1 #Everton. #Koscielny, totally unmarked, heads home #VanPersie's corner. Two goals in six minutes - complete turnaround."
FT 2-1 #Arsenal. A triumph over adversity as #Arsenal make this about their fighting spirit and not a difficult night for referee Lee Mason.

"@GurjitSoor Agreed- #Arsenal have been tracking him, as have #Liverpool. Signed a new long-term deal at #Ajax last year though."
#Nasri starts for #Arsenal.
"#Arsenal: #Szczesny, #Eboue, #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Song, #Wilshere; #Walcott, #Fabregas, #Nasri; #VanPersie. #Arshavin on bench."
Stunning move from #Arsenal - #Walcott jinks inside and plays it to #Fabregas who flicks it to RVP and his shot is saved well.
#Arsenal 0-1 #Barcelona. They had their warnings. #Messi slides in #Villa and he makes no mistake. It was tight but definitely onside.
"HT 0-1. Which is probably fair. #Barca passing majestic at times, but #Arsenal still in it. #Song on a tightrope after his yellow."
#Arsenal 1-1 #Barcelona. It comes out of nothing. Clichy plays in #VanPersie who beats #Valdez at his near post. Shocking keeping.
"#Arsenal 2-1 #Barcelona. Oh my. #Nasri burts clear and squares it to #Arshavin, who curls a delightful shot in the corner past #Valdes."

"#Arsenal should be ahead. #Wilshere goes on a jinking run, #Fabregas plays a delicious ball to #Walcott, who hits the inside of the post."
#Arsenal 1-0 #Stoke. Visitors have been on the rack and #Squllaci heads home #Bendtner's cross to give scoreline a slant that reflects play.
#Arsenal well on top.... but out of nowhere #Carew crashes a shot from distance that forces a decent save from #Szczesny. Never done at 1-0.
"FT 1-0 #Arsenal. Nervy at times in the second half but job done. Question is, for how big a price? #Fabregas/#Walcott inj updates to follow."

#Arsenal 0-1 #Birmingham. #Johnson flicks a corner goalwards and #Zigic is there to glance it past #Szczesny. Game well and truly on.
"Got to say, #Arsenal are on the rack a bit here. They simply cannot handle #Zigic and #Birmingham are winning the 50-50's."
"#Arsenal 1-1 #Birmingham. Against the run of play, brilliant equaliser. #Arshavin cross and #VanPersie hits a stunning volley."
"HT 1-1. Decent game with a fiery edge that is bubbling beneath the surface. #Arsenal fortunate to still have 11 men, #Birmingham resilient."
"Its #Foster v #Arsenal right now - saves from Nasri, Rosicky, Bendtner, Nasri again... momentum all with the #Gunners..."
#Arsenal 1-2 #Birmingham. Its a calamity. #Koscielny and #Szczesny make a hash of a routine clearance and #Martins taps into an empty net.

"#Arsenal 3-0 #LOrient. Suicidal fromOrient, #Bendtner makes it three with a low drive that bobbles into the corner."
#Arsenal 4-0 #LOrient. #Bendtner hat-trick - penalty after Gibbs was brought down by Revell. 2nd hat trick for the club - 1st v Porto.
#Arsenal 5-0 LOrient. #Clichy lashes one home from inside the box. Harsh on Orient who have played with spirit but no quality in final third
"#Arsenal (4-2-3-1): #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Djourou, #Koscielny, #Clichy; #Wilshere, #Denilson; #Arshavin, #Nasri, #Diaby; #Bendtner."

"HT 0-0. #Nasri looking most likely, #Wilshere couple of nice passes but #Arsenal subdued and crowd agitated. More needed in 2nd half."
#Arsenal turning up the heat now - #Wilshere's cross finds #Chamakh whose powerful header cannons back off the bar.
FT 0-0. #Arsenal gave it the kitchen sink at the end but that's a big opportunity missed. Its only #Barcelona next too...

Stadium announcer read out #Arsenal team - all surnames except 'Cesc'.
#Arsenal got away with one there. #Diaby on #Messi very close to box. Not given. #Barca dominating but they've only had 2 shots.
"#Barcelona 1-0 #Arsenal. Had to be #Messi. He'd just missed a glorious chance earlier. Iniesta's pass, scoops ball over Almunia and finishes"
#Barcelona 1-1 #Arsenal. #Busquets heads #Nasri's corner into his own net. Game on!
"#Barcelona 2-1 Arsenal. #Iniesta. Had been coming. Wonderful move, cool finish. 20 mins left before extra time as it stands."
#Barcelona 3-1 #Arsenal. #Messi converts easily after #Koscielny fouls #Pedro.
Oh #Arsenal could have stolen it. Wilshere feeds Bendtner but poor touch and it gets away from him. #Wenger on his knees in tech area.
FT 3-1. #Arsenal are out. #Wenger waits for referee and disappears down the tunnel deep in conversation. VanPersie red was harsh.
#United set up to win 1-0. Different system but #Arsenal must be sick of this at OT- same as Dec. #Wenger must find a response though.
"Forget psychological blows, #Djourou out for any lengthy period of time is a big loss for #Arsenal. Being stretchered off at Old Trafford."
Just the league then for #Arsenal. No disgrace losing at OT but #Wenger has big task rallying side's self-belief now.
#Arsenal in talks to resign #Lehmann on emergency loan.
"@GurjitSoor On a short-term deal, and as a free agent, Arsenal could do worse. Not sure how #Almunia will react though. They never got on."

#Arsenal all but signed #Gervinho. Fee is £10.5m and a 4-yr deal. Expected to be announced before end of week. Should hasten Bendtner exit.
@Darren_Oakley You dont seem to be alone in that sentiment. Always thought he's half decent but not an Arsenal player.
@mainakhazra05 It seemed earlier in the week #mcfc had stolen a march on #Arsenal but #Wenger still keen on him. 1st choice before Samba.
#Barca offer was nearer to £30m for #Cesc. Paper reports #Arsenal want £60m is a tactic- meet in the middle at £45m. That's the asking price
@RajCrew £45m for a player who started only 29 games and who wants to leave isn't bad money. #Arsenal much weaker without him though.
"#Arsenal set to confirm #Gervinho and #Cahill deals this week. £12m for former, #Cahill yet to be finalised. Has £17m release clause though."
"@arsenalreport Ha! Gervinho virtually done, Cahill less so - that one is more complicated but Arsenal confident."
Back from long holiday. Nothing changed for my money - still feel #Fabregas will leave #Arsenal and #Nasri will stay as said a month ago.
"#Arsenal trying to sign Real Madrid teenage striker Jose Rodriquez. Named Best Player at U17WC. Visited Colney, compensation being discussed"
Real offered Rodriquez a professional contract as a counter move. Player mulling it over but Wenger claims he'll be in #afc side quicker
#Arsenal team photo at the club's Members' Day has been postponed due to bad weather at Emirates Stadium. Bullet dodged.
"#Fabregas and #Nasri training at Emirates. #afc say team photo to be at Colney in 2 wks ""Rain delayed it, any other speculation is nonsense"""
#Arsenal drawn against Udinese in CL play-off round. Finished fourth in Serie A last season. Exact dates to follow. #afc
#Fabregas not on trip to Portugal is a late decision. Ominous for #afc chances of keeping him. Saga needs to end soon for everyone's benefit
@MeiriAdi Hard to disagree. Letting it drag on this long is bad for everyone. Barca behaviour poor but #afc must realise when they're beaten
"As has been reported elsewhere, Oxlade-Chamberlain is indeed undergoing a medical at #Arsenal."
"#Bendtner confirms on Sky Sports News he will be leaving #Arsenal. ""I want to play somewhere where I am happy and play every week."" #afc"
#Arshavin says he won't be leaving #Arsenal  this summer
"#Arshavin, linked with Russian club Anzhi, said: ""They are things invented on the internet. I will play in Arsenal colours."""
"#Fabregas deal close because he has indicated he will waive £4m compensation payment #afc would give him for ""not breaking his contract."""
#Nasri off too by the looks of it. £22m to Man City. Sky reporting #afc have made contact over Birmingham's Scott Dann. Cheaper than Cahill.
Some good news for #Arsenal fans: word from Colney is #VanPersie and #Vermaelen will be fit to face #nufc. Wilshere and Gibbs struggling tho
Strange press conference with #Wenger at #afc. He did say nobody would leave this month but overriding feeling is Fabregas and Nasri will go
on if they will leave as it would weaken #afc's negotiating position. Still expect the pair to leave tho. Just trying to get the best price.
#afc now have a little over 2 weeks to replace #Fabregas in the market. #Wenger didn't appear to be close to anything when speaking last wk.
#Wenger said earlier today #Arsenal wouldn't contest any #Song ban. Don't really see how they can either...
Right call to make @Persie_Official captain at #afc & #Vermaelen vice. Let's hope injuries are behind both now as they must lead by example.
"#afc team v Udinese: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen, #Gibbs; #Song, #Ramsey; #Gervinho, #Rosicky, #Walcott, #Chamakh."
Perfect start for #afc as #Walcott gives home side the lead but Udinese no pushovers. Just hit the bar.
"Oh my, Arsenal living dangerously here. Defence looks leaky. Szczesny saves well after #Armero bursts through on goal."
HT 1-0 #afc. #Walcott stand out performer but alarm bells at the back. Di Natale very lively - hit bar + post. More goals in this surely.
FT 1-0 #afc. I don't know how Udinese haven't scored. No away goal conceded could be vital but it'll be a tough night in Italy next Weds.
Decision on #Song's ban expected from FA this morning. Expected to be banned for 3 matches. #afc
"@LyallThomas For the record, he didn't get my vote! Although Parker would suit #afc. Wants a big contract tho as it'd be his last big move."
#Nasri deal expected to be completed by the weekend after #Arsenal accept £22m bid. Few details to be sorted but should sign for #mcfc soon.
"Little #Nasri update. He's in Manchester today, #afc haggling over exact structure of the payments but should all be completed soon."
"#Arsenal plan to appeal UEFA charge against #Wenger, according to club source."
"#Djourou and #Traore ruled out. #Rosicky out too- he will be ""rested"" for tomorrow. #afc"
Impressed by #lfc organisation but these are dire times at #afc. Could get so much worse if #Udinese are not seen off on Weds. Huge game.
"#Arsenal to appeal #Wenger ban. Club claim UEFA are ""unclear"" as to whether an appeal means Wenger won't be banned for Udinese match on Wed."
#Nasri still should join #mcfc. #afc agreed £22m deal but at last minute agents demand £3m payment taking total to £25m. Compromise expected
@Longy1806 @Gooner_66 #afc made enquiry about M'Vila from Rennes. Would cost around £12m but not may be reluctant to sell.
"@NorthBankJay Exactly. Its a case of how quickly the appeal hearing can be arranged. #afc don't know, #UEFA don't have automatic procedure."
#Nasri training at Colney this morning with #Arsenal.
I've just landed in Italy ahead of #afc's game tomorrow with to hear club confirm #Nasri's move to #mcfc should be finalised tonight.
"For any #afc fans coming out to Italy and saddened by #Nasri departure, I can say it is baking hot here. Bring your shades and sun lotion."
@sarahsportmag Fair enough- am struggling for plus points regarding #afc right now! Looks like Wilshere could be out for longer than thought
@frank361afc Must have been a great night. Udinese good going forward but fancy #afc to score. It'll be close though.
#Wenger to be on touchline for second leg as UEFA organise appeal hearing for after tomorrow night's game v #Udinese. #afc
#Wenger says he will look to sign 1 or 2 players to strengthen his squad regardless of if #afc exit Champions League.
"#Nasri completes move to Man City. Four year deal worth around £165,000-a-week. He'll wear No19. Fee thought to be £24m. #afc"
Talk #afc could be in CL regardless of result tonight cos they're 5th in UEFA co-efficient table. Statement at 7.30pm wont be definitive.

"#Jenkinson looks vulnerable to the pace of Armero, Di Natale typically a threat. #afc set up to score away goal but concerns at the back."
"UEFA confirm Trabzonspor will take #Fenerbahce's place in CL. Arsenal, you are on your own."
#Udinese 1-0 #afc. Di Natale header.
"HT #Udinese 1-0 #afc. Deserved goal for best player on pitch, Di Natale. Away goal would change everything but character defining 45 ahead."
#Rosicky on for #Frimpong for #Arsenal at half time.
#Udinese 1-1 #afc. Huge goal. Great work from Gervinho to find #VanPersie to sidefoot home.
#Udinese 1-2 #afc. Walcott races clear and kills the tie.
#FT 1-2 #afc. Vital win secured with character and grit. Rode their luck but a job well done under the circumstances.
"Seen #Nasri's interview with #mcfc TV. Amazing how he endlessly refused interviews at #afc in part cos of his English, but now its improved."
"#Arsenal will go back in for #Cahill. Been No1 centre-back target all along, #Wenger keen + recommended by chief scout Steve Rowley."
"@Goofle11 @northbanklower #afc were in for Jones, absolutely, but Cahill been a long standing interest. Right about Jagielka, same for Samba"

"#afc:  Szczesny; Jenkinson, Djourou Koscielny, Traore; Coquelin, Ramsey, Rosicky; Walcott, VanPersie, Arshavin."
Same #mufc team as against Spurs. Rio on bench. Concern for #afc is vulnerability in wide areas- Jenkinson and Traore against Nani and Young
#mufc on top and look the more likely but #afc holding their own. Odd atmopshere inside OT - usually rocking for this fixture.
#mufc 1-0 #afc. Livelier now. Anderson scoops the ball over #afc backline and #Welbeck heads home.
Penalty to Arsenal
"#mufc 2-0 #afc, Young curls a superb effort into the top corner."
"#mufc -0 #afc. Superb free-kick from Rooney. Top corner, Szczesny did well to get a hand to it. Result sorted, question of how many now."
#mufc 3-1 #afc. #Walcott beats DeGea too easily - went with feet instead of hands - from acute angle.
"HT 3-1 #mufc. Welbeck goal soft, Young & Rooney goals superb. Top De Gea save from RVP pen, poor keeping for Walcott goal. 3-1 flatters #afc"
#afc fans havent stopped singing in this second half and it is lifting the team - #mufc started half well but #afc getting a foothold now.
"#Oxlade-Chamberlain on for his debut, Coquelin off. #afc fans still singing... ""we love you Arsenal"" over and over..."
#mufc 4-1 #afc. #Rooney free-kick again. Beats Szczesny in the flight.
"#mufc 5-1 #afc. Rooney plays in #Nani, #afc all over the place and he dinks it over Szczesny."
"#mufc 6-1 #afc. Park in on the act, scoring from Young's pass."
"#mufc 6-2 #afc. #VanPersie volleys home. Emphatic finish. Insane game, this."
#mufc 7-2 #afc. Rooney scores to complete his hat-trick.
#mufc 8-2 #afc. #Young curls another fine shot past Szczesny.
#Arsenal in talks to sign Mertesacker from Werder Bremen. Club debt means he's available for £8m. Bolton's Cahill stance proving restrictive
Still expect #afc to sign midfielder. M'Vila tops the list above Sochaux's Marvin Martin and Lille's Eden Hazard. #Arteta enquiry dismissed.
Cant help feeling that #Bendtner hasnt left #afc yet because of the gap between the clubs he thinks he can play for and those that want him.
"Waiting for flight to Bulgaria. Key #eng games lost amid deadline madness. Arteta proven PL class, not sure how good Benayoun still is #afc"
"#ff @benrumsbyPA for Chelsea info, @jimvanwijkPA if you want to know about Arsenal, love for Norwich and his kids."
#Arsenal knew setback over #Wilshere injury was coming- partly explains decision to sign Benayoun on loan. Loan ins very rare for #Wenger.
"#Wenger to serve 2-game touchline ban after UEFA rejects #Arsenal appeal ""for not abiding by earlier decision""."
#afc right to be upset- seemingly given conflicting messages by UEFA. Whole issue needs clarification for future incidents.
Park been included in #afc squad although he's awaiting visa. Paperwork should be done tonight but doubt he'll start. Not met team-mates yet
"@j4cksm1th Understand why you feel that way but a lot of Arsenal fans think I'm too harsh on them, non-Arsenal fans too kind. Can't win!"

"#Benayoun playing in holding role alongside Song, Arteta further forward. 4-2-3-1 #afc"
"Mmm, maybe 4-3-3 when they attack- Barca-esque (in shape at least). Song deep with Arteta and Benayoun pushing on. #afc"
"Whatever the system, #afc living dangerously here. Dortmund missed three good chances already. Defence looks nervy."
#Dortmund 0-1 #afc. Terrible mistake at the back and Van Persie is put clear to score.
HT 0-1 #afc. Clinical from #VanPersie to give Arsenal the lead against the run of play.
A 'what we have we hold substitution' as Frimpong comes on for Walcott. Under 15 left #afc 1-0 up.
#Dortmund 1-1 #afc. What a strike. Free-kick cleared only to #Perisic who strikes a stunning volley into the top corner.
FT 1-1. #afc denied a morale-boosting win by a stunning late strike. Dortmund worthy of a point on balance of play but cruel late blow.
"On the train to Manchester for #mufc v #cfc. Should be a belter. Still trying to digest #afc result at #brfc. In a way, worse than the 8-2."

#afc 0-1 #Shrewsbury. Oh my. Awful marking and Collins heads home from close range.
Youthful #afc team but Benayoun doesnt close down the cross and Djourou is all at sea at centre-back.
@JamesG_City_AM Truly woeful defending. Plenty of time (and surely #afc have a goal in them) but worrying signs.
"#afc 1-1  #Shrewsbury. Gibbs heads home, it has to be said, against the run of play after Jenkinson's cross isn't cleared."
HT 1-1 Shrewsbury good value for parity. #afc OK going forward (nothing more) but alarming at the back. What's new?
#afc 2-1 #Shrewsbury. Decent strike from #Oxlade-Chamberlain but gk Smith should do better. It had been coming. #afc better in 2nd half.
"#afc 3-1 #Shrewsbury. #Benayoun seals victory from substitute Oguzhan Ozyakup's (he's a debutant and Dutch, believe it or not) pass."
"FT 3-1 #afc ultimately had too much but Shrewsbury deserve credit for first half display. Oxlade-Chamberlain, Benayoun and Coquelin good."

#afc 1-0 #Olympiacos. Terrible defending but Oxlade-Chamberlain finishes smartly - very composed and deadly that.
Superb block on the line from Arteta to deny Djebbour an equaliser. Just the kind of commitment to the cause #afc fans want to see.
#afc 2-0 #Olympiacos. #Santos scores his initial cross is blocked and he beats the keeper at his near post.
"#afc 2-1 #Olympiacos. Arsenal simply asleep from a corner and they work it to Fuster, who is unmarked, to head home. Awful."
FT 2-1 #afc. Nervy at the back (Spurs watched with interest?) but did enough for important 3 pts. Oxlade-Chamberlain's stock grows.
"Stats: Shots: #afc 10-15 Olympiacos, on target afc 5-7 Olymp, possession afc 54-46 Olymp. Job done and players rested but not convincing."
#Wenger urges fans to lay off Adebayor and focus on supporting #afc. Right sentiment but not sure if they'll listen...

"#Arsenal announce pre-tax profits of £12.8m but big rise in wage bill to £124m, 4th highest in PL."
Wage bill rise is for improved deals across the squad. No massive earners in comparison to top 3 but maybe it needs restructuring. #afc
#Apologies - #afc is £14.8m pre-tax profit.

Back to the game... can't see this ending 1-0. Both sides a threat going forward. #afc #thfc

#afc dominating in midfield now. #Redknapp bringing on #Sandro to stem the tide. #thfc.

#afc 2-1 #safc. RVP delivers. Superb free-kick (which he won himself) has surely broken the visitors' resistance.
FT #afc 2-1. Nervy finish. #VanPersie makes the difference (where would they be without him). Spirited #safc performance but fell short.
Always thought #Rosicky was a thoughtful and committed player but consensus on here is #afc fans aren't convinced by his answer.
"@deanowasthere89 Thanks for reading. Funnily enough, most Spurs fans like I am an Arsenal fan. its a fine balance."
#Vermaelen has signed a new contract with #Arsenal until 2015. Good for the club they have sorted out their best defender early. RVP next?
"#Marseille captain #Mandanda: ""We haven't talked about #afc a lot with the coach but we know that they can concede quite a lot of goals."""

"On that evidence, #afc fans can forget about #Cahill in January or any other centre-back for that matter..."
Bigger night for #afc back four though - Jenkinson/Mertersacker/Koscielny/Santos. Talented #OM forward line will provide stern test.
"Slovenian referee a little card happy here. Song and Santos already booked for #afc, #Ayew for #OM. Could be a red if it goes on like this."

"HT 0-0. Open game and #OM very much a threat, especially down the flanks. #afc been in and out - Park very quiet. How long until RVP?"
#Rosicky on for #Ramsey now. #OM edging this and #afc need energising. No doubt Wenger will say the #cfc game took a lot out of them.
#Arshavin on now for Gervinho. Last throw of the dice from Wenger as #afc look for a winner. 0-0. 13 mins left.
FT 0-0. Fair result on balance although #OM may feel they could have nicked it. #afc still in charge of Group F but need win v Dortmund now.

Dortmund look a threat early on. Remember Lewandowski's profligacy in the first meeting - better finishing and it could be tough for #afc.
"Gotze, who received treatment earlier on, is forced off injured. Big boost for #afc. Perisic, who scored an uber volley in 1st game, is on."

"Koscielny coming off - looks to be an injury as he walks gingerly to the touchline. Djourou on. 7 mins left, as it stands #afc group winners"
Diaby now on for Walcott. First #afc appearance for the Frenchman since final day of last season at Fulham.
#afc 2-0. Van Persie again. Game over. Vermaelen flicks on a corner and Van Persie is unmarked to thrash it home.

"Olympiacos 2-0 #afc Howler from Mannone. He clears, Fuster turns it goalwards and Mannone swings a left leg at it, misses and it goes in."
HT 2-0. Olympiacos benefiting from awful #afc defending. Must do better in 2nd half as more goals look likely.
#Olmpiacos 2-1 #afc. Miquel's cross is chested down by Chamakh and Benayoun volleyed home.
FT 3-1. Late third settles it but odd atmosphere here as Olympiacos go out because of late Marseille winner. Didn't matter but #afc poor.
@AnthonyLeaver mufc had easiest group and failed. Had been getting away for it for a while. #afc in better shape by the day. All well?
Wilshere ups the bet with Defoe to 5k over who goes finishes higher between #afc and #thfc in talksport interview.

Wow. I guess it doesn't always pay to win the group. AC Milan v #afc in CL last 16.
"#afc team v #mcfc: #Szczesny; #Djourou, #Mertesacker, #Vermaelen, #Koscielny; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Gervinho; #VanPersie."
"So #afc unchanged from team that beat Everton. Likely to be Vermaelen at left back in that case but either way, 4 centre-backs in defence."
#Song needs to be careful for #afc. Already booked and he is main main in midfield to stop powerful forward surges from YToure etc.
"HT 0-0. #mcfc shown more cutting edge but #afc work rate excellent in defence. Bad Aguero miss, Ramsey bright on the ball. First goal is key"
Maybe it is that bad. Miquel readying himself to come on... #afc
"Djourou limps straight down the tunnel. Koscielny now at right-back, Vermaelen at centre-back alongside Mertesacker, Miquel left back. #afc"
#mcfc 1-0 #afc. Silva close range header.

Spoken to FA this morning who confirm #Arteta is NOT suspended for #afc game against #avfc on Wednesday. Only had 4 bookings this season.
Gibbs not expected to be fit for #avfc game after medical assessment today. #afc back four set to be same that finished against #mcfc.

"#afc: #Szczesny, #Djourou, #Mertesacker, #Koscielny, #Coquelin; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Gervinho; #VanPersie."
HT 0-1 #afc. Worth it and could be more. #ffc can't get Zamora in the game but good work rate suggests they'll give it a right go in 2nd 45.
Wenger's decision to take Walcott off greeted with cheers in #afc end. He was poor today. Rosicky on. Fulham pressing for an equaliser tho.
Arsenal so depleted in numbers that Squillaci is now on for the final 10 minutes. #ffc pressing hard for an equaliser.
#ffc 1-1 #afc. Arsenal fail to deal with a corner and Sidwell heads home from three yards out.
#ffc 2-1 #afc. Zamora volleys home inside the near post. Stunning comeback from Fulham.
"#Wenger: ""They tried to get Johan a second yellow. In the end, he got it."" #afc"
Only admin and processing documents holding up #Henry loan. Time diff to New York (-5 hrs) isn't helping but should meet 12pm deadline. #afc

Ladbrokes tell me a few punters had read the script - #Henry's goal has cost them £100k tonight. #afc

On @bbc5live shortly after 3pm as part of pre-match build-up to #Swansea v #Arsenal. Tune in if you can/ so wish.
#Arteta is set to miss #afc game v Swansea after picking up a knee injury in training. Benayoun his probable replacement. Not confirmed yet.
"#afc: #Szczesny; #Djourou, #Mertesacker, #Koscielny, #Miquel; #Song, #Benayoun; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Arshavin; #VanPersie. (Henry on bench)."
"#Swansea 0-1 #Arsenal. Arshavin slides a ball into #VanPersie, who beats Vorm a touch easily right-footed at his near post."
#Swansea 1-1 #Arsenal. Sinclair converts after Ramsey is adjudged to have fouled Dyer. Only seen it once but looked very soft.
HT 1-1. Great start for Arsenal but Swansea been the better side since Sinclair's pen. All set up for #Henry again?
"Arsenal out early for the 2nd half. A rollocking, perhaps? Its Swansea who make a change though. Sigurdsson on for Agustien."
"#Swansea 2-1 #Arsenal. Ramsey loses the ball carelessly and Swansea work it to Dyer, who smashes it past Szczesny."
"#Swansea 2-2 #Arsenal. Djourou pass releases Walcott, who dinks a superb finish over Vorm."
#Swansea 3-2 #Arsenal. Oh my. Graham is sent clear and he outpaces Koscielny before slotting a neat finish past Szczesny.
"OxladeChamberlain now on for Arsenal. Past (Henry), present (Van Persie) and future (the OC) now in tandem to try and salvage something."
FT 3-2 Swansea. Superb display from Swansea full of resilience and character. #afc didn't have enough of either & need defenders back.
"#Wenger: ""The referee gave a penalty was a complete imagination and a dive. Well done to him."" #afc"
Remarkable press conference. Wenger answered one question and got up to leave (police escort waiting). Answered 2 more as he walked out.#afc
"#afc official confirms incident between away fan shouting abuse at FT & Henry, who replied ""Support your team."" Henry says was 'no big deal'"
"To give Wenger his due, after complaining about the referee, he did praise Swansea's display and admit to Arsenal's poor defending. #afc"
Boost for Arsenal. #Arteta and #Vermaelen winning fitness battles to face Man Utd on Sunday. Should be available barring any late setbacks.
@harryiscesc Transfer snippets?! Arsenal are doing nothing at the moment. Honestly. Its dead quiet.
#Arshavin will stay at Arsenal this month but looks set to leave the club in the summer. Full story here: http://bit.ly/yPQ6zR  #afc
"#Arteta had a setback- out for Sunday. Vermaelen facing fitness test, Henry also having fitness test, Sagna and Gibbs 2-3 wks away. #afc"
"@samuelj29060 More annoyed at #afc press office to be honest. They talked me round re Arteta. Still, these things happen."
@dhicir Yep. Can only apologise. Was talked round re Arteta by #afc press office. Will be having words but my responsibility. Sorry.
"Henry has ""very few chances"" to be fit for Sunday, says Wenger at London Colney. Vermaelen has ""a little chance"". #afc"
"VanPersie in #afc programme: ""I'd never lost a match 8-2 before so I'm hungry to put that right, as is the entire team."""
"#afc: #Szczesny, #Djourou, #Mertesacker, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen; #Rosicky, #Song, #Walcott, Ramsey; #OxladeChamberlain; #VanPersie."
#mufc monopolising possession now and gradually turning the screw. Decent Szczesny stop from Nani - #afc need a foothold in the game.
#afc 0-1 #mufc. Valencia on the stroke of half-time heads home Giggs' cross.
"HT 0-1 #mufc. Better side lead. Not an accident that 1 #afc full-back doesn't stop the cross, the other is beaten by Valencia."
Djourou off at half-time. United had clearly targeted him in the first half. Can Yennaris do any better? #afc
Better from #afc. Staggering Torres impression from VanPersie as he misses a sitter before Ramsey fires over. Surely more goals in this?
Park and Arshavin imminent for #afc
"#afc 1-1 #mufc Flowing counter attacking move as OxladeChamberlain finds VanPersie, who levels after Rafael caught upfield."
"#afc 1-2 #mufc Arshavin is beaten too easily by Valencia, who plays a 1-2 with Park and then feeds Welbeck, who smashed home,"
A number of fans sarcastically hand-clapping Wenger for Arshavin's poor defending in the build up to that goal. #afc
Now its Park off and Ramsey on. No booing of that decision #afc have six minutes to salvage something.
"FT 1-2 #mufc Decent second half fightback from #afc but poor defending cost them. Rarely, if ever, have I seen afc fans so irate at Wenger."

@tonyneilson85 @timpayton @darrenarsenal1 @arseblog Their view may well be that he has kept Arsenal competitive without spending.

"#afc 0-2 #avfc. Fantastic finish from tight angle at the second time of asking by Bent. Ireland released him, Bent delivered."
HT 0-2 #afc Boos ring out round stadium. Villa well-organised - nothing more - #afc abject in defence. Tall order for Henry to salvage this.
#afc 2-2 #avfc. Two in three minutes as Hutton's clearance hits Walcott and flies in following Van Persie's penalty.
Penalty to Arsenal.
#afc 3-2 #avfc Van Persie slots home again- the other side- after Bent brought down Koscielny. Remarkable turnaround.
"FT 3-2. #afc Stirring comeback as #avfc capitulated completely. The Ox superb, MOTM again and played without fear. Defence still shaky tho."
Van Persie in the clear over alleged elbow on Cuellar. Sensible decision. #afc
"#Eisfield completes move to #afc. £600k, 4-yr contract. Miyaichi to join Bolton on loan until summer. That's it for Arsenal as it stands."
#afc about to travel up to Bolton ahead of tomorrow's game. Been told #Arshavin is travelling with the squad.
...that club announced on Fri. Will be assessed in next 2 weeks to confirm comeback date. Club doctors NOT yet ruled him out for season.#afc
Remember those 'cold nights up north' Arsenal were famed for hating? I can confirm it is both 'cold' and 'up north' at the Reebok. #afc
Sagna starts for #afc. Team to follow.

"#afc could be 3-0 up. RVP header off the line, Ramsey and the Ox waste good chances. What often happens next is the other side scores..."
"HT 0-0. Not sure how. #afc missed several golded chances. RVP, the OX, Ramsey all culprits. N'Gog wasted two at the other end. 1st goal key."
"As pointed out by @MAYET_A, Walcott's miss probably the worst of first half. Back underway here, Arsenal start 2nd half on top."
#bwfc playing almost entirely in their own half and looking to hit on the break but #afc can't quite open them up. 0-0 65 gone.
Superb by RVP - chips a delightful effort that hits the bar. Rosicky on for Ramsey. Time running out for #afc. #bwfc sensing a winner too.
FT 0-0. Entertaining. Best #afc chances never fell to RVP. Supporting cast fluffed their lines. N'Gog could have had 3 for #bwfc.
"#afc team: #Szczesny, #Sagna, #Vermaelen, #Koscielny, #Gibbs; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey,   #Rosicky; #VanPersie."
"Wilshere, Jenkinson and Santos all here in the San Siro tonight despite injuries to support #afc"
"Concerned about #afc left. Rosicky must be disciplined, Gibbs only just back. Also, think Ibrahimovic is overrated. He'll score 3 now..."
#Milan 1-0 #afc. Boateng scores with a superb volley in off the bar. The Spurs connection doesn't need mentioning.
"According to UEFA, #afc have had 53pc of the ball so far. It really doesn't feel like it."
"#Milan 2-0 #afc Ibrahimovic is away down the left and he feeds Robinho, who finishes from close range."
"#Milan 2-0 #afc. Ibrahmovic (responding to my jibe), Robinho and Boateng too much for Arsenal, who are defending badly and gifting the ball."
"#afc pass completion 69pc from 211, Milan's 70pc from 197. Remarkable. I'm watching a different game."
#Milan 3-0 #afc. Disastrous start to the 2nd half. Vermaelen slips allowing Robinho the space to fire home.
"Song going to centre half, Vermaelen left back as the Ox is on for Gibbs. #afc"
Been talking about #afc playing 4-4-2 for a long time - not sure this is the time to try it but an away goal would be a huge boost.
"#Milan 4-0 #afc. Djourou fells Ibrahimovic, who converts the spot kick. Tie surely over."
#afc's worst ever Champions League defeat was 3-0 at home to Inter in 2003 and 3-0 away to Shakhtar in 2000.
"FT 4-0 Milan. Ibrahimovic led #afc a merry dance. Abject performance, wasteful, careless and error-strewn. A total disaster."
Wenger furious with the 4th official at FT. Didn't know he was Arsenal's defensive coach...
I'm told its Arsenal's worst ever European defeat. Need to check that though.
Koscielny just walked through mixed zone fine enough. Didn't appear too serious but waiting for confirmation. #afc
Perhaps the most worrying thing for #afc is how predictable defeat to Sunderland was. Abject for the 2nd time in 4 days.
#Defoe stokes the fire and says north London derby means more to #afc than #thfc. Link to piece in tonight's Standard: http://bit.ly/zP1n16

"#afc 0-2 #thfc Adebayor converts confidently after Szczesny is adjudged to have brought down Bale, who was looking for it."
#afc 1-2 #thfc. Sagna heads home Arteta's cross moments after Van Persie hit the post. They deserve that for their effort.
#afc 2-2 #thfc. Incredible. #RVP collects Assou-Ekotto's poor clearance and works it onto his left foot to curl home a stunning effort.
HT 2-2. #thfc started with a poise that has evaoparted in face of #afc pressure. Penalty was big call - why no card? RVP superb. Great game.
#afc 3-2 #thfc. Rosicky scores after exchanging passes with Sagna and stealing in at the near post ahead of King.
#afc 4-2 #thfc. Walcott scores (and answers his critics) with a superb dinked finish from RVP's pass.
#afc 5-2 #thfc. Walcott scores again after collecting Song's through ball and beating the offside trap. This is absolutely mental.
"Parker sent off. Second yellow for bad challenge on Vermaelen, who refuses to shake Parker's hand by way of apology. #thfc #afc"

#afc announce pre-season friendly against #mcfc in Beijing. Friday July 27. Surely won't be the only game out there but only one confirmed.

@EGGsays Can't see it myself. It is an odd Milan team though - a few changes which is encouraging for Arsenal.
#afc 1-0 #acmilan Koscielny heads home unmarked from a corner. Awful from Milan. Game on. Surely not...
"#afc 2-0 #acmilan. Rosicky scores after yet more woeful defending. Thiago Silva's dreadful clearance comes straight to Rosicky, who finishes"
Penalty to Arsenal
#afc 3-0 #acmilan. #RVP converts after Nocerino and Mesbah combine to bring down the Ox.
"HT 3-0 #afc. Magical. Arsenal inspired, Milan defensively disastrous. Concede and they'll need 6 but they could get them playing like this."
#acmilan better this half but #afc still the more likely to score. 17 mins left to find 1 more to take it to extra time.
FT 3-0 #afc Heroic effort ends in gallant failure. Milan defended better in 2nd half but #afc restore pride in Europe.

"#afc 0-1 #nufc. Vermaelen is sloppy in possession and Newcastle work it to Ben Arfa, who drifts inside Gibbs and beats Szczesny at near post"
#afc 1-1 #nufc. Instant response. Walcott finds Van Persie and Williamson tamely falls to the ground as RVP controls it and smashes it home.
I've never understood the point of Obertan. He's off and Ameobi is on. #afc bossing it but no way through as yet.
#afc 2-1 #nufc. Vermaelen wins it at the death. Remarkable conclusion. Momentum undeniably with them in the PL right now.
FT 2-1 #afc Dramatic conclusion but what they deserve for never giving in. Krul trying to get near RVP in the tunnel. Those 2 at it all game
"#Wenger: ""Diaby is not far - small chance for Everton, Santos will play on Wednesday in the reserves, Jack (Wilshere) less imminent."" #afc"

@benashwell @Arsenal Thanks very much - very kind of you to say. Tough one at Goodison - think #efc cup exertions are a big advantage though
What a miss. Rosicky angles a ball into the box that RVP heads down and Ramsey lashes it over from about 10 yards out. Shocking. #afc
#efc 0-1 #afc. Vermaelen heads home Van Persie's corner. Reward for an authoritative start.
#Drenthe puts the ball in the net but he's flagged for offside. Replay shows he is clearly on - lucky escape for #afc.
HT 0-1 #afc Vermaelen caps superb display with goal. #efc show flashes but visitors largely in control. 3 harsh offside calls against #efc.

@AshinAFC That should play into Arsenal's hands if you ask me. Wolves certainly need the points though but hard to see a home win.
"#afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Djourou, #Vermaelen, #Santos; #Song, #Arteta; #Walcott, #Ramsey, #Benayoun; #VanPersie. Rosicky on bench."

"#wwfc 0-1 #afc Van Persie ends his 4-game goal drought with cheeky dinked penalty. Walcott burst through, Bassong clumsy. Definite contact."

"#wwfc fans singing: ""You've only scored two, you've only scored two...how s**t must you be, you've only scored two."" #afc"
HT 0-2 #afc. Utterly dominant after early penalty and Wolves red card. Home fans boo ref as he heads off. Looked a fair penalty call to me.
#wwfc 0-3 #afc. Benayoun drives the ball home from just outside the box after Song's pass. Harsh on the hosts who had been better this half.
"FT 0-3 #afc. Easy as you like for Arsenal after early sending off and pen. Game drifted in 2nd half, Wolves kept going but look doomed."

"#afc 0-2 #wafc. Great run by Moses and Gomez forces the ball home. Arteta off, Ramsey on (presumably an injury). Unbelievable start."
#afc 1-2 #wafc. Rosicky delivers a superb cross from the right and Vermaelen gets up to head home powerfully.
HT 1-2 #wafc. All #afc after those two early goals but not fluent enough in the final third. Shaky at the back too. Credit Wigan though.
"Given their PL status is at stake, Wigan are remarkably composed in possession. #afc trying to build momentum but missing Arteta's passing."
FT 1-2 #wafc. Deserved win. Wigan scored early but always offered a threat and played with great spirit and quality. #afc poor all round.
#afc can complain about timewasting - and there was a lot of it - but in truth they looked like they could play all day and not score again.
Just seen Arteta walk to the players' lounge on crutches and with right foot in a protective boot. Doesn't look good. #afc
"At Emirates. #afc: #Szczesny; #Sagna, #Koscielny, #Vermaelen, #Gibbs; #Song, #Ramsey; #Walcott, #Rosicky, #OxladeChamberlain;#VanPersie."
HT 0-0. #afc missing rhythm provided by Arteta's passing in midfield. #cfc dangerous but vulnerable at set pieces. There to be won for both.
Cahill has been excellent for #cfc today. Forming a very good partnership with Terry. Maybe #afc should have made a bid for him. Oh...
FT 0-0. #afc lacked conviction to take the game to #cfc enough. Decent point for Chelsea given Barca matches. Chance for #thfc to capitalise
"#Wenger: ""We didn't open them up enough and that is the regret I have today. It was similar to the Wigan game."" #afc"
"#Wenger: ""It'll be tough for Theo to come back this season (for Arsenal). I think he will be alright to play for England (at the Euros)."""
@AlexFortyNine Ajax want £10m and Arsenal are interested. Versatility would be a huge bonus for the club.
"@grahamsm1th Editorial policy? It's a column. I was at the Arsenal v Chelsea game, not at Spurs. Redknapp an issue but writing what I saw."
"Thanks to all for such kind words about my column yesterday on @aaronjramsey and #afc. For anyone interested, it's here http://bit.ly/If7B7f "
@Sawyer_Arsenal Sure. But why?
@Sawyer_Arsenal By what? The FA approaching Hodgson? Always had a lot of respect for him - very harshly treated at Liverpool.
@timpayton He did needlessly bomb forward late on though - you can take the boy out of Arsenal...
Krul booked for timewasting just as he was against #afc. It came back to haunt #nufc that day. Will it again? 10 mins added time.
"#VanPersie: ""We had a hard summer with Samir and Cesc leaving but we came back really well."" #afc"
"#VanPersie on future: ""We still have to set a date but we still have to have a meeting, me, Ivan Gazidis and the boss."" #afc"
"#VanPersie: ""Arsenal is an unbelievable club and the player I am today is because of Arsenal."" #afc"
"#VanPersie: ""Whatever happens with me, I will always feel a Gunner."" #afc"
At Colney. Wenger rules out #VanPersie leaving this summer and is hopeful he will finish his career at #afc
"M'Vila £17.7m deal to #afc is close. Not done yet. Wenger hoping he will augment and not replacement Song, who is yet to agree a new deal."
"Confusion over M'Vila. Player's camp claim deal (& fee) agreed, #afc sources say they are no longer interested. Am believing the latter now."
... I may of course be wrong but #afc sources I trust insist no deal is likely. Wenger speaking to media at 12.30 tmw. May shed some light.
"#afc confirm assistant manager Pat Rice to leave the club at the end of the season. ""Announcement on a successor to be made in due course."""
"At Colney. Wenger on Rice: ""Arsenal was priviledged to have him as a player, captain and coach..."""
"Wenger: ""... I would like him to forgive me for the bad moments I have given him as well."" #afc"
"Wenger confirms Steve Bould will succeed Pat Rice as No2. ""He knows our football philosophy, therefore there will be continuity."" #afc"
Wenger says Walcott (hamstring) will resume training and have a fitness test tomorrow ahead of Sunday's trip to West Brom. #afc
"Wenger says there has been no contact with M'Vila, no interest at the moment and claims Arsenal are not close to buying anybody. #afc"
@SchwartzSaxon And you. Although I was at the Etihad so Arsenal coverage will be taken care of by others! Thanks for reading the paper.
"@WarrenHaughton In fairness, any team with Crossy in it is going to be Arsenal heavy..."
"As has been suggested elsewhere, Gazidis and Wenger will hold talks tomorrow with Van Persie to discuss a new contract. #afc"
"Wilshere on talkSPORT responding to Nasri's #afc trophy drought jibe: ""Maybe he spoke too soon and we can rub it in his face next year."""
"#Wilshere to have ""minor"" knee op on ""long-standing patella tendon issue"" say #afc. Club claim it won't affect comeback from ankle injury."
#afc standing firm over Van Persie. Making noises they'll run down contract if no agreement reached. Could change tact though as with Nasri.
"Djourou quoted in Switzerland today: ""My situation at #afc is not easy. I’ve never played so little and especially not in my own position."""
"Zenit CEO Maxim Mitrofanov quoted in Russia on #Arshavin: ""We believe that we've shown Arsenal how to deal with players as they train."""
@DarrenArsenal1 Fair enough. Don't think he has ever recovered from the United game in Arsenal terms.
"@timpayton Fair point. Yes, Arsenal appear to be doing good business early although RVP situation getting more ominous."
"Fixtures out. Those involved know PL game after CL is key aspect of season. #afc's are M City a, WHam a, QPR h, Fulham h, Villa a, WBA h."
"#mcfc have five out of six at home too following CL. Arsenal h, Sunderland h, Swansea h, Tottenham h, Chelsea a, Man Utd h."
@Arsenal_SAfrica Yep. Definitely the media's fault we lost 4-1 to Germany two years ago.
@Arsenal_SAfrica Clearly you have never read anything I have written. Do your research before you cast aspersions.
"Arsenal complete #Giroud signing. He said: “I was attracted by the philosophy of football and Arsène Wenger’s 'touch' at this club."""
"On holiday but heard RVP news. Think #afc will demand he sees out his deal but if player wants to go, Juventus is his preferred option."
@timpayton All seems alarmingly familiar. They need to resolve RVP situation asap. Bubbling along in the #afc boardroom too by all accounts.
Fulham interested in signing Andrey Arshavin after Arsenal tell him he is no longer required. In tonight's Standard: http://bit.ly/PCRYI4 
"Meanwhile, #Cazorla confirmed by #afc. Club record fee of £16m - quite a statement but will it be enough to convince RVP to stay?"
Correction: It appears #afc got Cazorla for less than originally thought. Fee actually in the region of £12m. Decent price.
Walcott long considered himself a striker - might get a chance for England before Arsenal. Carrick in - does that mean he'll play regularly?
"On RVP, I think he will end up at #mufc. Arsenal holding firm over £25m price but it looks like a compromise will be reached eventually."
Walcott out of #eng friendly tomorrow with a thigh problem - only precautionary. Expected to be fit for #afc this weekend.
"Despite public declaration, #afc would sell Song to Barca if price is right. 2 yr left on deal, no indication he'll sign a new one. Cash in?"
Some misinformation flying around about Song- spoken to #afc who confirm 3 years left on his deal. Point stands though...(1/2)
...It may be early but indication at this stage is he's unlikely to renew. And #afc are willing to sell if price is right.
"RVP to #mufc completed. All parties wanted it done before PL kicked off. For #afc, at least they avoided the same delay as when Nasri left."
@PenfoldLawrence For who? Risky for both. At least Arsenal have bought earlier this time so they aren't short.
"On RVP, #mufc privately claiming »15m rising to as much as »22m with add-ons. #afc say »20m rising to as much as »24m. Who to believe?"
Losing Robin Van Persie and the challenges to Arsenal's philosophy in tonight's Evening Standard: http://bit.ly/Ps4FXY 
@StuTheGlu Not by nature but he's the most defensive-orientated midfielder #afc have.
"@NeilPayne This is Arsenal, you know the answer!"
"Wenger: Walcott fitness test this morning, Koscielny (calf) out, Cazorla travelling back from Puerto Rico and will be assessed. #afc"
"Wenger on Song leaving and a big name arriving: ""Both could happen."" #afc"
@DarrenArsenal1 May take some time to come together but there's a lot for Arsenal to be optimistic about.
Breakdown in relationship between player and manager a considerable factor in Song leaving #afc. Wenger's remodelling continues.
"@attwood10 Liverpool convinced they will get Sahin, Arsenal too. Agent playing games I would reckon. Think he'll go to Arsenal as it stands."
@attwood10 @AFCAMDEN @darrenarsenal1 Am off for a couple of days but my understanding was that he'll go to Arsenal.
"Update on Sahin to #afc: Wenger doubts Sahin can perform defensive midfield role. Agent looking for alternatives, #lfc interest revived."
Sahin prefers move to Arsenal but Wenger mulling it over. Should all be sorted out in next 48 hours - #lfc interest will force a decision.
"Money, ambition definite issues but Walcott wants assurances he'll play more as a CF in future. Listed as a striker in last #eng squad. #afc"
"Park, Chamakh and Bendtner all not at #afc training ground today. Park left with ""two big suitcases"" apparently. Suggests exits are close."
"Wenger: ""Szczesny faces tests today and tomorrow, Koscielny back in the squad (to face Liverpool)."" #afc"
"London CL draws: Group B: #Arsenal, Schalke, Olympiacos, Montpellier. Group E: #Chelsea, Shakhtar Donetsk, Juventus, Nordsjaelland. #UCLDraw"
Park understood to have passed a medical ahead of loan move from #afc to Celta Vigo.
Think Essien to #afc is unlikely. Club considered it but #cfc want permanent sale. Player would be keen but can't see it at this stage.
"Brilliant train service out of Euston for #lfc v #afc. Train delayed because of overcrowding. When I say brilliant, I really don't mean it."
"#afc team: Mannone; Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Arteta, Diaby; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Cazorla, Podolski; Giroud."
Mannone solid at Stoke but this a much bigger test. Sahin's #lfc debut another interesting dimension - Wenger decided not to sign him. #afc
Due respect paid to Bill Shankly today on what would have been his 99th birthday. Players out and we're nearly underway. #lfc #afc
#lfc 0-1 #afc. Lightning breakaway. Cazorla feeds Podolski who slots left-footed past Reina.
"HT 0-1 #afc Although #lfc edged opening exchanges, #afc had more end product. Fine Podolski strike. Both sides must improve in possession."
"#lfc 0-2 #afc Cazorla beats Reina, a little too easily it has to be said, after playing a clever one-two with Podolski."
"FT 0-2 #afc Huge result for Arsenal and their self-belief. Diaby superb, Cazorla, Arteta, Podolski all good. #lfc badly ran out of ideas."
Diaby's role in #afc's win at #lfc offers hope Wenger's midfield transfer policy is right. In tonight's Standard: http://bit.ly/SdHOSj 
Arshavin set to stay put at #afc despite interest from Russia (their transfer window closes tonight). Wants to fight for his place.
"Sagna quoted in L'Equipe criticising #afc transfer policy and hints he could be be next to go. ""Could I be tempted to leave?... (1/2)"

Big night for Montpellier tonight. First CL group stage match. Their fans in good voice. Think #afc should win though.
Giroud gets a warm reception (as coach Rene Girard predicted yesterday) as his name is read out over the PA system here. #afc #mhsc
#mhsc 1-0 #afc. That's cheeky. Belhanda dinks it down the middle. No replays here but the penalty award looks harsh.
#mhsc 1-1 #afc. Fabulous move carves the home side open and Podolski slots home.
#mhsc 1-2 #afc. Jenkinson drives a cross into the six yard box and Gervinho forces it past Jourdren. Superb turnaround.
"HT 1-2 #afc Great response after Behanda's early Panenka pen. Diaby superb, Podolski epitomised work ethic. Job not done yet though."
"UEFA now listing ""good chances"" on HT stats. Apparently neither side has had 1. And its 1-2 #afc. I'd have said a penalty was a good chance."
Mixed reception as Giroud goes off. Ramsey on. Gervinho now CF. #afc are riding the storm well here. 77 gone
"Having said that, Belhanda has just missed a sitter. Not out of the woods yet. #afc"
FT 1-2 #afc Resilient display in the face of improved #mhsc 2nd half showing. Rode their luck at times but great start to Group B.

"#afc team: Mannone, Jenkinson, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Arteta, Diaby; Ramsey, Cazorla, Podolski; Gervinho."
"Two rather odd team line-ups here. Tevez on the bench, Sinclair starts. #afc reshuffle presumably with Podolski at CF and Ramsey on right."
Vermaelen apparently has a virus and is replaced by Koscielny at centre half for #afc too.
"#mcfc 1-0 #afc Out of nothing, Lescott heads home Silva's corner. Mannone came and didn't get anywhere near it."
"HT 1-0 #mcfc Harsh on #afc who were better side without creating a great deal. Mannone at fault for goal, towering header from Lescott tho."
"#afc lacking an end product here. If only Wenger had a £12m striker to throw on... Problem is, Giroud badly lacking confidence."
"And with that, Walcott and Giroud are readied on the #afc bench."
#mcfc 1-1 #afc. Koscielny smashes it home after City fail to clear a corner. They had been turning the screw for a while.
FT 1-1 #afc deserved a point for their perseverance. #mcfc disjointed throughout. Two poor goals to concede defensively but a decent game.
Spoke to Arteta after game v #mcfc on his hopes for the season: http://bit.ly/Q0Hy3a  & my thoughts on #afc's midfield: http://bit.ly/Uy8H3p 
I don't often do this but... Walcott publicly admitted today that a contract issue with #afc is he wants to play as a CF. Wrote that in Aug.
@whatgap I phrased it as England should show the same patience as Arsenal have.

"#afc 1-1 #Olympiacos. Fabulous equaliser. Greco's pinpoint cross finds Mitroglou, who glances the ball into the far corner."
HT 1-1 #afc a little too laboured in possession. Sloppy at times too and Olympiacos had the best chance prior to Gervinho's opener.
#afc 2-1 #Olympiacos. Podolski nutmegs the keeper from close range after Gervinho's cutback.
"Walcott on for the Ox. Inside the final 20 minutes, #afc ahead but Olympiacos still carrying a threat. 2-1"
3-1 #afc Ramsey races clear and finishes smartly left-footed. Flatters them a touch as its been largely uninspiring.

Ramsey starting on the right of a 4-2-3-1 system for #afc.
HT 0-0 Cagey. #afc lacking cohesion in final third - Ramsey on right not working. #Schalke04 slick in possession but Huntelaar misfiring.
This game is being played how Schalke want it at present. Wenger needs to change things - #afc threat sporadic.
#afc 0-1 #Schalke04 Huntelaar scores.
Arshavin and Gnabry on for Podolski and Jenkinson. #afc have 7 minutes to salvage something. It doesn't look likely.
#afc 0-2 #Schalke04 Quick breakaway move. Jones feeds Farfan who squares it to Afellay. it came down the left. Who'd have thought?

#afc 2-0 #Montpellier Stunning left-foot volley from Podolski after a one-two with Giroud. Great goal.

Giroud on the bench for #afc
"#afc team: Szczesny; Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Arteta, Wilshere; Walcott, Cazorla, Ox-Chambo; Podolski."
#Readingfc 0-1 #afc Gibbs crosses and Podolski finishes smartly. Poor defending though.
#Readingfc 0-2 #afc Podolski cross and Cazorla scores. With a header. Great ball but where was the marking?
#Readingfc 0-3 #afc Cazorla turns the ball home from Gibbs' header after Reading fail to clear their lines.
HT 0-3 #afc Boos ring round the Madejski. Reading have been awful. But Arsenal have played well to take advantage. A question of how many.
"#afc fans breakout into a brief chant of ""Wenger, Wenger sign him up"" after Walcott bursts clear."
#Readingfc 0-4 #afc Superbly well worked goal finishes with Podolski crossing for Cazorla to tap home.
#Readingfc 1-4 #afc Le Fondre scores after Gibbs concedes possession as Wilshere slips over.
#Readingfc 2-4 #afc Kebe scores with Podolski playing him onside. Surely not...
Nope. #Reading 2-5 #afc Walcott gets the goal his performance deserves after more fine work from Cazorla.
FT 2-5 #afc Cazorla magical tonight. Front four always looked dangerous against a woeful #Readingfc side who still managed to score twice.
Expecting #afc's Boxing Day match against West Ham to be cancelled because of Tube strike. Likely to be re-arranged for end of January.

#afc drawn against Bayern Munich.
Arsenal have agreed framework of new 3-and-a-1/2 yr deal with Theo Walcott. Contract with lawyers- details TBC. Set to be announced next wk.

"At Emirates. #afc team: Szczesny, Sagna, Mertesacker, Vermaelen, Gibbs; Coquelin, Wilshere; Walcott, Diaby, Cazorla; Giroud."
Tempted to open up a sweepstake on which minute Diaby will be forced off through injury. Surprised he is starting again. #afc
HT 0-0 Bartley's header against the crossbar the nearest anyone has come. #afc started OK but lacking cohesion. Vermaelen close at the end.
#afc 1-0 #swans Wilshere scores. Finally.
FT 1-0 #afc Wilshere MOTM performance capped with a fine goal. Deserved win having dominated for long periods. #swans looked jaded.

#cfc 2-0 #afc Lampard scores after Szczesny fouls Ramires.

#afc team out early for the second half. Riot act may well have been read.
#cfc 2-1 #afc Walcott scores from Cazorla's pass.
Fine finish from Walcott. #afc rewarded for improved display since HT. Fascinating final half hour in prospect.
#cfc fans baying for changes here. Rafa still does nothing. Torres trying but surely Ba has to come on. #afc looking more likely to score.
"Believe it or not, Arshavin is about to come on. #afc"
FT 2-1 #cfc Decent fightback from #afc but ultimately left themselves with too much to do after a dreadful start. Boost for Rafa to hold on.

Some pre-match reading on #afc v #lfc and Aaron Ramsey's midfield role. In tonight's Standard: http://bit.ly/VXgExs 
#afc 0-1 #lfc Suarez scores
That goal was a mess from a defensive point of view. #afc failing to clear their lines. #lfc reward for pressing high up the pitch.
"HT 0-1 #lfc pressing well prompting #afc panic. Chaotic defending from Arsenal undermining their efforts in attack. Suarez, Gerrard good."
#afc 0-2 #lfc Henderson somehow bundles his way through and scores at the second attempt.
#afc 1-2 #lfc Giroud heads home Wilshere's free-kick. Poor defending. Giroud drifted off Agger.
"#afc 2-2 #lfc Walcott smashes it home and from absolutely nowhere, Arsenal are level."
"FT 2-2 Usual mixed bag from #afc. Can play superbly in patches, defensively poor. #lfc should have put it out of sight before they tired."

"He's joking, by the way. Wenger also once again ruled out any move for David Villa. #afc"
"""...were the reasons why he decided to buy shares in Arsenal."" #afc"
"Arshavin will remain at Arsenal as things stand. Turned down a move to Reading, #afc keen to get him off the wage bill but no takers yet."
Walcott will note the irony that he's listed as a midfielder for #eng again having been a striker in previous squad & for #afc at times.
"#afc in talks with Malaga for Nacho Monreal. Fee not agreed yet. 1st choice ahead of Gibbs when fit? Either way, it demotes Santos..."

Giroud on the bench so presumably Walcott up front. He's wanted to play there in a big game for a long time. Tonight is his chance. #afc
Some pre-match reading if required. #afc have faltered in big games with slow starts. Cannot do so tonight. http://bit.ly/XL30eU 
#afc 0-1 #Bayern Kroos fires home from the edge of the box. Disastrous start for Arsenal.
#afc 0-2 #Bayern More bad defending. Van Buyten's header is saved but Muller forces it over the line. Bayern are good value for it.
"HT 0-2 #Bayern. Gulf in class obvious. #afc undone by poor defending as much as anything. That said, Bayern composed & authoritative."
#afc 1-2 #Bayern A goal from nothing. Bayern switch off from a corner and Podolski nods home.
Rosicky and Giroud imminent. #afc
"How Arsenal should have lined up? Walcott crosses from the right, Giroud's first touch is a fine effort blocked by Neuer."
"#afc 1-3 #Bayern Lahm's cross from the right, Mandzukic and Sagna try to meet it, the ball loops up and drops in the net."
FT 1-3 #Bayern A galling night for #afc. Outclassed & undone by dreadful start. Bayern oozed confidence. Mission impossible in the Allianz.

#thfc 1-0 #afc Bale is put through by Sigurdsson and the Welshman sidefoots past Szczesny.
#thfc 2-0 #afc Lennon is sent clear from Parker's pass. He rounds Szczesny and scores. White Hart Lane erupts.

#fcbm 0-1 #afc Now then. Rosicky feeds Walcott who crosses dangerously into the box and Giroud slams it into the roof of the net.
HT 0-1 #afc. #fcbm missing Schweinsteiger more than Arsenal miss Wilshere. Much better & more resilient from #afc.
Oxlade-Chamberlain and Gervinho coming on. Ramsey and Walcott coming off. Arsenal have 19 minutes to score twice. #afc
#fcbm 0-2 #afc Koscielny forces the ball home. Arsenal have four minutes to get another.

Danny Welbeck is at #afc's training ground. He would prefer joining #afc over #thfc & is trying to force through a deal. Wenger's move now.

"Debuchy at centre-half again, presumably to try and combat Sterling's pace through the middle. #afc"
#lfc the better side early on here but #afc will probably be happy enough. They were 4-0 down by this point in February.
#lfc 1-0 #afc Coutinho scores on the stroke of half-time with a low drive in off the post.
#lfc 1-2 #afc Stunning move. Giroud plays a one-two with Cazorla and fires Arsenal in front. Against the run of play but a fine goal.
#lfc 2-2 #afc Skrtel powers home a stoppage time header to equalise.

HT 1-0 #afc An even contest. Arsenal causing a variety of problems with their pace but Ramires missed a glorious chance to equalise.
No handshake between Mourinho and Wenger at full-time. #afc win 1-0. First win for AW in 14 attempts over Mourinho.
"Mourinho shakes the hand of every #afc player, ignores Wenger, walks down the tunnel and chucks his runners-up medal into the crowd."

Had a few technical problems but finally sorted. Good test this for #afc now - #whufc resilient and well organised.
#afc 0-2 #whufc Zarate doubles the Hammers' lead. Cech initially took a step the wrong way. Not a good PL debut for him.
Wenger brings on Sanchez (having said initially on Friday he wouldn't play) as Arsenal have 23 minutes to salvage something. 0-2 #whufc.
FT 0-2 #whufc The anticipated second-half siege never came. #whufc resilient & clinical. #afc ran out of steam. A few boos at FT.

#afc 3-0 #mufc That is sublime. Sanchez works the ball onto his right foot and smashes it into the top corner.
Don't understand LVG's decision to omit Schneiderlin. United bypassed in midfield due to #afc's pace.
HT 3-0 #afc Stunning half from Arsenal. Sharper in every department and 3 excellent goals. #mufc no cutting edge to their possession.

Koscielny (hip) fit enough for the bench. But hard not to feel biggest problem for #afc could be Douglas Costa lining up against Debuchy...
#Bayern 1-0 #afc Thiago crosses for Lewandowski who heads past Cech. No replays here. Offside?
Twitter tells me it was onside (thanks to all). Arsenal think they've equalised but Ozil used his elbow to convert Monreal's cross.
"#Bayern 2-0 #afc Coman scuffs a shot but it falls to Muller, who converts from 12 yards out."
#Bayern 3-0 #afc Alaba bends one into the top corner from 25 yards. Game well and truly over.

"#afc fans in positive mood... ""We're gonna win 5-4"" they chant at the Allianz."
"#Bayern 4-1 #afc Decent goal, that. Sanchez clips the ball into Giroud, who chests the ball and acrobatically volleys into the net."
#Bayern 5-1 #afc Muller sidefoots the ball home to complete a slick Bayern move. Clever finish.
FT 5-1 #Bayern A rout. #afc's CL hopes hanging by a thread now. Think Wenger went straight down the tunnel without shaking Guardiola's hand.

"#afc 1-0 #mcfc Wonderful strike from Walcott, cutting in on his right foot and burying a fine effort past Hart."
#afc 2-0 #mcfc Terrible pass from Mangala. Ozil assist (of course) as Giroud fires through Hart and into the net.
HT 2-0 #afc Contain and counter working a treat for Arsenal so far but #mcfc still carry a threat. Interested to see how long Aguero lasts.
"#afc 2-1 #mcfc Sagna squares the ball to Yaya Toure, who sidefoots brilliantly into the top corner from the edge of the box."

Huge night for Iwobi. Flamini's last hurrah - #afc midfield provided no cover in 4-1 defeat here in 2010. Massive job for him and Elneny.
"Without Coquelin & Walcott/Campbell (& maybe PM), this is arguably #afc's strongest available team right now. Giroud off form for a while."

#afc's faint title hopes - and they were tenuous to start with - are extinguished by that result. No FA Cup to mask the misery either.

"#afc: Cech, Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Xhaka; Ramsey, Iwobi, Sanchez; Giroud."
#Bournemouth 1-0 #afc Bellerin is a top defender but he won't like watching that back. Daniels beats him far too easily and converts.
#afcb 2-0 #afc Wilson converts after Xhaka fouled Fraser. Mountain to climb for #afc now.
"HT 2-0 #afcb Home side everything #afc aren't: energetic, focused & dynamic. Big test of Wenger & his team's ""mental strength"" here..."
"Dizzy penalty challenge for a few fans on the pitch at half time here. As they run up, they look like Arsenal did in that first half."
#afcb 3-0 #afc Fraser beats Bellerin and then slots a finish past Cech. Wenger furious as he thinks Bellerin was fouled.
"""This is embarrassing,"" sing the #afc fans. Hard to disagree with that."
#afcb 3-1 #afc  Sanchez converts at the back post after Giroud helps on Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross.
"#afcb 3-2 #afc Perez hits a superb volley from a tight angle after Giroud's layoff. They couldn't, could they?"
"#afcb 3-3 #afc Giroud equalises in stoppage time. Remarkable game, remarkable comeback."
FT 3-3 Superb game. Jekyll and Hyde performance from #afc containing reasons why they could yet win the PL & also why they probably won't.

"#AFC: Cech, Gabriel, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Ramsey, Xhaka; Sanchez, Ozil, Iwobi; Giroud."
#afc's recent habit of starting poorly has continued here. Nowhere near as bad as Bournemouth/Preston but Swansea growing in belief. 0-0.
#Swansea 0-1 #Arsenal Giroud turns the ball home from close range after Swansea fail to clear.
"HT 0-1 #afc Scoreline a little harsh on Swansea. Although goal had a clumsy climax, it came at the end of an excellent move."
#Swansea 0-2 #afc Iwobi's shot takes a huge deflection and loops over Fabianski.
#Swansea 0-3 #afc Naughton own goal from Iwobi's cross.
#Swansea 0-4 #afc Sanchez scores from close range. That is the cue for the home fans to start filing out.
"Sanchez & Ozil taken off with 12 mins left here. #afc so comfortable, Wenger could spend the rest of the game talking contracts with them."
FT 0-4 #afc Arsenal recovered from a slow start to rack up an easy win in the end. Important after recent away day misery.

#afc not quite on it in the final third yet but brighter start than in recent games. Burnley occupying #afc by keeping two up when possible.
"HT 0-0 Some agitation around Emirates after a frustrating half for #afc. Burnley defending resolutely, #afc not passing with enough tempo."
#afc 1-0 #Burnley Mustafi heads home Ozil's corner.
Xhaka will be banned for four matches (unless #afc win an appeal). Contact looked minimal but diving in like that invites trouble.
#afc 1-1 #Burnley Gray converts from the spot. Wenger furious.

#afc 2-1 #Burnley Sanchez converts - panenka - to give Arsenal a dramatic win.

#afc 0-1 #Watford Kaboul's low drive is deflected off Ramsey past Cech.
#afc 0-2 #Watford Shambolic defending. Capoue dances through and his shot is saved by Cech but the rebound falls to Deeney who converts.
This is possibly worse than Bournemouth away from Arsenal. And that really is saying something.
"HT 0-2 #Watford. Hey, remember when teams worked out you stop #afc by pressing high up so they make mistakes? Well, that's happening. Again."
Giroud off at half-time. Walcott on for #afc
#afc 1-2 #Watford Iwobi scores from Sanchez's cross to halve the deficit.
FT 1-2 #Watford #afc improved (couldn't get any worse) but Watford held on for a deserved win. Title challenge in tatters.

#cfc 1-0 #afc Cech saves Costa's header but Alonso turns home the rebound.
#afc look vulnerable to #cfc's aerial power. Bellerin off injured which means Hazard v Gabriel on #afc's right...
"Atmosphere hits a lull here. #afc fans sing: ""Is this is the Emirates?"""
HT 1-0 #cfc Debate about the goal but personally think no foul. #cfc on top but #afc could be level had Gabriel taken great chance.
#cfc 2-0 #afc Fantastic strength from Hazard as he scores a stunning solo goal.
#cfc 3-1 #afc Giroud scores with a near-post header. Conte was applauding the fans singing his name when it happened.
FT 3-1 #cfc Deserved win which takes Chelsea 12 points clear and ends #afc's title hopes. Difficult questions for Wenger now.

Looks like usual 4-2-3-1 shape for #afc with the ball. Ox and Iwobi dropping into more of a 4-4-1-1 without it as they try to stay compact.
#Bayern 1-0 #afc Arsenal sit off Robben and he takes advantage by curling a shot into the top corner.
Penalty to Arsenal
#Bayern 1-1 #afc Sanchez equalises from the rebound after Neuer saved his penalty.
#Bayern 2-1 #afc Lewandowski climbs highest to plant a header past Ospina.
#Bayern 3-1 #afc Thiago rifles a close range finish past Ospina. Magnificent flick from Lewandowski to assist.
This is precisely the moment where #afc have to remember the tie is 180 minutes long. 3-1 wouldn't be a total disaster.
"#Bayern 4-1 #afc Arsenal are capitulating. Thiago scores again, unfortunate deflection off Xhaka."
#Bayern 5-1 #afc Muller adds a fifth. Tie over.

#afc go three at the back again.
"#afc: Cech, Gabriel, Koscielny, Holding; Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, Xhaka, Monreal; Sanchez, Ozil; Giroud."
"HT 0-0 Shades of Jan 2015 about this in #afc's approach. But to repeat that win (2-0 away at #mcfc), they'll have to keep riding their luck."
#afc 0-1 #mcfc Aguero breaksaway and finishes past Bravo.
#afc 1-1 #mcfc Wing-back to wing-back. Oxlade-Chamberlain crosses and Monreal equalises.
#afc fans singing for Danny Welbeck to come on here. Giroud has not had one of his most effective days.
#afc 2-1 #mcfc Sanchez reacts quickest to turn the ball home from close range.
FT 2-1 #afc Arsenal find a way. Tremendous resilience. Wenger reaches 8th FA Cup Final. Big celebration from him at full-time.
Nice touch from Mikel Arteta to wait for former #afc team-mates and congratulate them before disappearing down the tunnel.

Welbeck on and a switch to a back four for #afc
#afc 1-0 #lcfc Monreal's shot hits Giroud and goes in. A huge slice of luck.
FT 1-0 #afc Not quite the full-time euphoria of Sunday from Wenger but clenched fists nevertheless. Arsenal get over the line.

HT 0-0 #thfc should be ahead. #afc have had their dangerous moments but need more from Giroud in attack.
#thfc 1-0 #afc Alli turns the ball home from close range. White Hart Lane erupts.
"#thfc 2-0 #afc After being fouled by Gabriel in the box, Kane steps up to double Tottenham's advantage."
It is moments like this when Wenger's insistence on waiting to make substitutions does #afc no favours.
FT 2-0 #thfc Deserved win which confirms #thfc will finish above #afc for first time since 1995. Cech #afc's best player by a mile.

"Whole stadium singing about Wenger now. #afc fans: ""Arsene Wenger, he's won more than you."" Stoke: ""Arsene Wenger, we want you to stay."""
Better start from #afc than at Southampton. Beginning to boss possession now and create chances. Stoke offering very little so far.
#Stoke 0-1 #afc Never doubted him. Giroud has a tap-in from Bellerin's cross.
"#afc fans: ""1-0 to the football team."""
HT 0-1 #afc Loud boos from the home fans. #afc deserve their lead - much more purpose about their approach. Closing in on the top four...
"Despite the animosity between these clubs, #afc fans applaud Stoke's U23s, U18s, Ladies and Reserves teams as they embark on a lap of honour"
"#afc fans: ""How s*** must you be, we're winning away."""
#Stoke 0-2 #afc Ozil doubles Arsenal's advantage. That should be that.
#Stoke 1-2 #afc Crouch gets Stoke back into the game but it looks like handball. Wenger went onto the pitch to remonstrate. Players furious.
"The stadium has come alive here. Suddenly, this final 20 minutes has become a real test of nerve for Arsenal."
Sanchez is signalling to come off here. Worrying signs for Arsenal.
And then he scores! Incredible. Stoke 1-3 #afc Sanchez finishes in off the post.
#Stoke 1-4 #afc Giroud slides home from close range. Arsenal move to within one point of the top four.
FT 1-4 #afc Impressive victory that moves Arsenal within one point of the top four. Pressure on Liverpool ahead of their trip to West Ham.
There was already talk of a fan boycott of #afc's game against Sunderland on Tues. Can see them staying away in droves after #lfc win today.
"#afc have an interest in Pickford and he's proving why so far. Several good saves already but Arsenal yet find a way through. 0-0, 24th min."
HT 0-0. #afc well on top but Pickford has been in fine form to keep them out. Game there for the taking though.
#afc go to four at the back with a double change- Welbeck and Iwobi for Ramsey and Gibbs.
"#afc fan slow to return the ball when it drifts out of play. Mustafi screams: ""Give me the ball, for f***'s sake!"""
#afc 1-0 #Sunderland Ozil and Sanchez combine for the latter to score from close range.
#afc 2-0 #Sunderland Sanchez doubles their lead and that should be that.
FT 2-0 #afc Sanchez makes the difference again. #afc must hope Middlesbrough put up similar resistance at Anfield as Sunderland did here.
#afc have a chance of a top 4 finish. That's more than looked possible a few weeks ago. Comment on #afc's 2-0 win: http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/alexis-sanchez-sets-up-final-day-shootout-for-arsenal-but-arsene-wenger-still-insists-top-four-is-a3541166.html …

Usmanov has made a big offer to buy #afc but Kroenke not keen on selling as it stands. Improved offer or no CL could change things.
"At Emirates. #afc: Cech, Holding, Koscielny, Gabriel; Bellerin, Xhaka, Ramsey, Monreal; Sanchez, Ozil; Welbeck."
#afc 1-0 #efc Reward for a bright start. Unbelievable miss from Welbeck but Bellerin spares his blushes with the follow-up.
"Such a strange moment from Koscielny. #afc were ahead and in control, hadn't been a bad tackle in the game and then out of nowhere, that."
"#afc 2-0 #efc Sanchez doubles Arsenal's lead. Everton seemed to stop, believing Welbeck was offside in the build-up."
HT 2-0 #afc #efc seemed to realise near the end of the half that they have a man advantage. Good from #afc but job not yet done. Good game.
More defensive problems for #afc - Gabriel now being stretchered off. Left leg injury. Looked painful. Mertesacker on.
#afc 2-1 #efc Lukaku scores from the spot. Handball given against Holding.
"#afc fans: ""Stan Kroenke, get out of our club."""
#afc 3-1 #efc Lovely curled finish from Ramsey settles this game.
FT 3-1 #afc Hard-fought win achieved despite losing Koscielny early on but proved in vain. Fifth place finish means Europa League next year.

#afc 1-0 #cfc Lineman flagged for Ramsey but Sanchez was onside and the goal is given.
Just seen replay of goal. Clear handball from Sanchez - big slice of luck for #afc. #cfc seem in post-PL title slumber at the moment.
Mesut Ozil just made a crunching tackle on Eden Hazard. #afc being bang up for this in a microcosm.
HT 1-0 #afc better all over the pitch & deservedly in front. #cfc need a half-time rocket. And Fabregas to give them more guile in midfield.
Mertesacker is defying conventional wisdom here on 1st start for 13 months. Holding #afc together at the back.
"#afc 1-1 #cfc Costa equalises, chesting the ball down and firing a shot past Ospina."
#afc 2-1 #cfc Incredible. Instant response. Ramsey puts Arsenal back in front.
