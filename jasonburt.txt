
Fulham v Arsenal today for me. Report in tomorrow's Sunday Telegraph...
@Youaremygooners  I've no idea who you are and why you are so angry and abusive. The Arsenal story will develop but you need to calm down.
"Have dipped back into Twitter and, yes, I know its important to update on the Arsenal takeover story I did. I work on it every day."
"@TruroBlue Martins never joined Arsenal, as you know. But they spoke to him, as you probably don't know. Sorry you are so angry."
Was at #AFC #EFC today. Felt like a very big win for Arsenal and also a recognition of the importance of the FA Cup. Great cup tie.

As reported by Telegraph Sport on Saturday Sunderland offered £2m loan fee for Carl Jenkinson. Hard for Arsenal to refuse. Blow to West Ham
@Mikey75Mp @TerryGladden Arsenal will not sell Jenkinson.
@snowbiggee @TeleFootball Would agree. Was there for Wilshere's debut for Arsenal + thought best England midfielder I had seen Gascoigne
But evidently Arsenal fans simply simply think I don't like Wilshere. Link won't work which is frustrating..I saw him debut. Brilliant.
Expect Petr Cech to Arsenal to be done this week. Neither club confirming but moving towards agreement it seems.
"Still can't quite believe CFC are letting Cech join Arsenal but, if happens,  shows Abramovich is man of his word. Has huge regard for Cech"
If (when) Cech joins Arsenal  expect Christophe Lollichon to go with him as gk coach. The pair are v close + Courtois may want his own man
Petr Cech from Chelsea to Arsenal for £11m should be announced on Monday. All agreed. Still can't quite believe that one is happening.

On Radio Five Live Sportsweek show from 9-11am for start of new season and then on to Arsenal v West Ham United..
At Arsenal v West Ham. Looking forward to see whether Arsenal can put down a marker.. but also how Payet + Reece Oxford (still just 16) cope
1-0 West Ham at h-t at Arsenal. Cech will be blamed. Maybe a bit harsh but if he comes he has to get. Good half. Good intent from West Ham
F-T: 0-2. Brilliant win for West Ham at the Emirates. Payet and Oxford (95pc pass accuracy) outstanding. Reality Cech for Arsenal...
I'm surprised  that Wenger has left out Oxlade-Chamberlain at Crystal Palace. He's been Arsenal's best player in last 2 matches!
That deal was done then West Ham pulled out after beating Arsenal. But then Ade on £110k a week.. https://twitter.com/i_spye_0/status/634856818141999104 …
At Arsenal v Liverpool. Both teams hit by injuries... wonder if Benteke can get at the Arsenal central defensive partnership.
"H-t: Cech (Sorry, Arsenal) 0 Liverpool 0. Ramsey goal should have stood but just how did Liverpool not score.."
Arsenal will face Bayern Munich in Group F!
Safe to say Man Utd (PSV) and Chelsea (Porto) will be happiest so far... Man City (Juventus - Pogba?) and Arsenal (Bayern Munich) not so..
Arsenal - Bayern Munich and now Olympiakos. A bit better for them..
"Arsenal: Dinamo Zagreb, Bayern Munich, Olympiakos"
"That's a tough draw for Man City (again). Sting in tale for Man Utd with Wolfsburg but they, Arsenal + Chelsea should be happier."
Must read column on Arsenal from @GNev2https://twitter.com/telefootball/status/637323839127465985 …
Told Wilshere booked in for surgery on Thursday. Arsenal insist no final decision take yet on whether he needs an op https://twitter.com/telefootball/status/643746341508792320 …
Arsenal now confirming surgery. Op is on Thursday with metal plate inserted  https://twitter.com/telefootball/status/643789991764729856 …
"Bilic has won at Arsenal, Liverpool and Man City in West Ham's first 3 away games. That is utterly remarkable. No fluke either"
Spurs v Arsenal tonight.. both have put out strong teams here at White Hart Lane..
Incredible winning goal by Flamini. Good win for Arsenal. Criticism of Kane unfounded. He will be fine for Spurs
Been out doing an interview. Got back to catch up with Arsenal. No sense in Wenger leaving out Cech. Without being rude just plain stupid
Nothing Ospina can do with that but 59 secs between Arsenal equaliser and that is unforgivable.
Arsenal no points. And home and away v Bayern to come now. Blimey they have made a mess of this. What does Wenger have to say?
Arsenal and Chelsea losing in Champions League tonight. Without standing on ceremony this is piss poor..
On way to Man Utd v Wolfsburg. Hopefully Utd and City can fair better than the London clubs. Still can't believe Arsenal's performance
"Arsenal news: We can be naive, admits Arsene Wenger, as Gunners boss feels the strain - via @Telegraphhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/11908803/Arsenal-news-We-can-be-naive-admits-Arsene-Wenger-as-Gunners-boss-feels-the-strain.html …"
Suspect that win v Arsenal is proving a huge life raft for Mourinho right now. But last time he challenged Chelsea to sack him...
At Arsenal v Man Utd. Looks like Darmian back to rb to cope with Sanchez and Young at lb for Man Utd. Interested to see how Walcott fares.
And Sanchez scores.. 1-0 Arsenal
"3-0 FT. Brilliant from Arsenal. Brittle from Man Utd. Strange, unpredictable season this.."
"Very, very impressive from Arsenal. Set the standard now. But not playing Schneiderlin a bad decision by Van Gaal"
"Huge win for Arsenal over a brilliant Bayern Munich. They really, really wanted that."
Arsenal influence at Aston Villa to grow! Don't think Moyes will be moving.. https://twitter.com/telefootball/status/658416216789417984 …

At Olympiakos v Arsenal.. would suggest Arsenal just keeping giving the ball to Ozil and they can definitely do this. 0-1.
0-2 Arsenal. One more goal and Olympiakos have to score 3. Arsenal need to keep attacking and they can kill this off
0-3 and surely Arsenal through. Remarkable stuff. They would have to concede three times now to go out..

Sounds like Verratti is playing well v Arsenal. As I leave a wet Etihad here's a piece with him...  https://twitter.com/jburttelegraph/status/775331004219265025 …
PSG trying to get Marco Verratti red card against Arsenal over-turned but not heard yet if they have been successful
"Liverpool have beaten Arsenal and Chelsea away, drawn away at Spurs and beaten Leicester at home. That's a strong start to the season."
At Nottingham Forest v Arsenal... where the visitors have made just the 11 changes pic.twitter.com/RRP7P7yZU9
Just the three changes for Forest (v Arsenal) including a first start for Nicklas Bendtner
Very much enjoyed Arsenal's performance tonight. Made 11 changes and put away a potentially dangerous tie away to Nottingham Forest 4-0.
At Arsenal v Spurs. Spurs have gone 3 at the back. Alli out with knee hurt in training. Should be ok for England duty but not certain.
PSG furious that Serge Aurier has had his visa revoked by UK authorities and cannot play against Arsenal. Story on @TeleFootball soon..
Uefa also expected to issue a statement in support of PSG and Serge Aurier after he had his visa revoked and cannot play against Arsenal
At Emirates where Watford are deservedly 2-0 up and Arsenal appalling. Only consolation is they have a lot of time...
H-T: Arsenal 0 Watford 2. And it should be even more for Watford. A lot of booing..
Arsenal back in it. Iwobi goal. Still  lots of time left..
"FT: Arsenal 1-2 Watford. Deserved win by Watford; poor from Arsenal. Big opportunity lost, maybe."
What's so odd about Wenger's 'mentally ready' comment is that Watford were not direct or physical. They just outplayed Arsenal in first-half
At Bayern Munich v Arsenal. Thomas Muller on the bench... pic.twitter.com/ab42XGAZG4
"Arsenal been abysmal second-half. Lack of leaders... and Kieran Gibbs is now captain. One goal back, though, and there is hope?!"
Bayern 5 Arsenal 1 FT. Arsenal so bad that even the PA announcer was laughing as he read out the score after the fifth goal.
Spoken to a few people today + definitely get the sense that if Arsene Wenger leaves Arsenal this summer he still wants to carry on working
It happens time and time again but it is incredible how poor Arsenal are in these kind of games.
Feels like Groundhog Day in every sense for Arsenal. Unfortunately has to be Wenger's season. Do not buy 'there's no alternative' argument
Apparently the Arsenal 'stats' showed Sanchez was not as effective/ working for the team of late. The stats were wrong. Big call by Wenger
Not in business of knocking down stories but told no chance at all Wenger has been offered PSG job. Everyone expects him to stay at Arsenal
"Up until those defeats away to Everton and Man City in Dec, Arsenal were averaging 2.27 points/ league match. Since then it's 1.33 points."
At Arsenal v Man City where some horrendous defending (again) and calm finishing has seen City take an early lead. 0-1.
Shocking defending and good finishing at the other end and it's Arsenal 1- City
One of the major reasons Lacazette is unlikely to want to join Arsenal is the balls-up they made trying to sign him last year
"Alisher Usmanov has made a bid to buy out Stan Kroenke at Arsenal as per Financial Times report. Not expected to go anywhere, however"
At Arsenal... 1-0 up but Koscielny just sent off.
2-0 Arsenal. Everton a shambles here
Arsenal fans booing Enner Valencia as he is substituted for the heinous crime of being fouled by Koscielny who deserved his sending off
Wenger doesn't talk like a man who is definitely staying at Arsenal.
Well done Arsenal. Superb display to win the FA Cup yet again. Excellent all over the pitch. Chelsea strangely flat
Told Monaco have rejected 3 bids for Mbappe already this summer including from Real Madrid and Arsenal. They keep saying he's not for sale.
Interesting that Port Adelaide say they will have a partnership with Arsenal as part of this. Talk of both being involved in China.. https://twitter.com/PAFC/status/876691684884570112 …
My understanding of Arsenal is that little can be done without sorting out Sanchez and Ozil. It's causing a lot of frustration
Arsenal want both Sanchez and Ozil to stay but little appears to be moving without that being sorted. Lacazette remains top target.
Said that Lacazette was Arsenal's no1 transfer target which is true. But main aim is keeping Sanchez/ Ozil and that's complicating matters.
Was told weeks ago that Monaco will not sell Bakayoko and Lemar in same window. So Chelsea's Bakayoko deal may kill Arsenal's Lemar chances
Appears this may get done early next week. Arsenal close on Lacazette. https://twitter.com/telefootball/status/880812109726179328 …
Sounds like Lacazette to Arsenal should get done. Just 4m euros apart in negotiations now. Could be a twist but appears likely.
Hope is now that Arsenal can agree Lacazette deal on Monday.  As previously reported little chance that they will get Lemar from Monaco.
Now told Lacazette will probably sign for Arsenal this weekend.
