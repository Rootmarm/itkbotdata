@DarrenArsenal1 @1979gooner You're wrong. Everyone points out how little Arsenal spend. But usually as a criticism ...
#MUFC v Crawley live on ITV at 5.15pm on Sat Feb 19. Leyton Orient v Arsenal on ESPN at 4.30pm the following day
"Wilshere completed 27/29 passes in 45 mins. Excellent rate but not like playing for Arsenal (more of the ball, others on same wavelength)"
"@Colinko True, like Arsenal being from Woolwich. But that was then. (Orient also considered moving to Harlow (!) a few yrs ago. But didn't)"
"Barça hard done by (and a brilliant, brilliant team) but when Arsenal let a lead slip like that in Prem Lge, they get panned ..."
@Chris_Faulkner @ragingbitch I wasn't talking about Newc game. Talking more generally about games where Arsenal wasteful/unlucky/careless
"In other words, boot was on the other foot for Arsenal tonight. They were outpassed & had some luck, but they looked braver/hungrier at end"
@SOLeary84 Of course Xavi IS better than Wilshere and of course Barça ARE better than Arsenal. But game changed in final 15 mins. It happens
Leyton Orient v Arsenal teamsheet #lofc #afc http://twitpic.com/41w9iq
"FA Cup QF draw was just read out at Orient. Loud roar from home fans, excited by trip to Old Trafford. ""Only"" Arsenal in the way"
What a goal! Jonathan Tehoue scores a stunning late equaliser for Orient against Arsenal
@_Tahseinur_ Well spotted. Must be an anti-Arsenal agenda. Either that or my internet connection was down for most of the game.
"@IamTils Sorry. Missed the derby as I was on a 400-mile round trip to London for Orient-Arsenal. So #lazyLondonjournos, yep ..."
"Fixture news in a nutshell: if you support United, Arsenal, City, Chelsea or Spurs, most of your April league games have been moved for TV"
#ff @domfifield @MattLawExpress @johncrossmirror @LaurensJulien @DWhiteFootball @henrywinter. Because they're sitting next to me at Arsenal
Arsenal haunted lack of authority and experience at the back - maybe lack of trophy-winning experience too. Back 5 looked nervous throughout
"@pbxl @steauneedarest @nickwastell Lack of trophies has played on Arsenal minds, as Sagna said. B'ham under no such pressure - as was clear"
"@AGT79 Arsenal lack authority and experience at the back. Not saying it's easily remedied, but how can you disagree with that assessment?"
@AGT79 Apologise? For regarding the Szczesny/Fabianksi/Almunia-Djourou/Koscielny/Squillaci axis as Arsenal's weakness?
"Arsenal confirm Robin van Persie has flown to Barcelona and is in squad for tmrw's game, having previously been ruled out"
Van Persie starts for Arsenal. Diaby and Wilshere in central midfield with Fabregas ahead of them
RT @johncrossmirror: #Barcelona v #Arsenal team sheet http://twitpic.com/47jcpq
Almunia coming on for Szczesny after 18 mins. Szczesny injured finger saving Alves free kick. Not what Arsenal wanted 0-0
Inevitable Arsenal recriminations after some poor refereeing from the usually excellent Busacca. But Barca really are in a different class
"@GazzettaCalcio That's what I said, ie Barca in a different class. Simply pointing out what Arsenal were focusing on"
"@AnthonyCalder You're an Arsenal fan, no doubt supportive of their philosophy, and you think Barça are/were ""s**t""? Forgive me if I disagree"
"Leaving Barcelona. Some sympathy with Arsenal, but best team won. Not convinced red card outweighed ref errors in Arsenal favour in 1st leg"
"@ChemicalBarry Two things won't change regardless of what Arsenal end up with: 1 Wenger has the odd blind spot, 2 Wenger is perfect for them"
"Webchat starting very shortly (subs or £1) http://thetim.es/h5Ewts Barca-Arsenal, Spurs-Milan, media ""witch-hunts"" etc..."
And yes they had an easier draw than Arsenal (AC Milan easy? only comparatively) but they earned that by winning a tougher group
RT @ftw997: @OliverKayTimes blatantly supporting spurs and slagging off arsenal. Biased much? --> Erm. No. Which of us is being objective?
@EirikHOP No. You need to realise that praising Spurs for reaching QF and praising Barca for being rather good doesn't make me anti-Arsenal
"Fergie (in reasonable mood) confirms Nani out for #MUFC v Arsenal tie tmrw, outside chance back for Bolton next wk"
"7 defenders, VDS, Gibson, Rooney and Hernandez start for #MUFC v Arsenal. Presume Fabio, O'Shea and maybe Rafael in midfield"
Chamakh on for Denilson. Arsenal plenty of possession but little punch up front so far and vulnerable to counter-attack. 61 min 2-0
Djourou stretchered off - and applauded by whole crowd. Day doesn't get any better for Arsenal. 86 min 2-0 for Utd
"United fans singing (about Arsenal) ""You're just a s**t Barcelona"". Not the worst insult I've ever heard"
"FT 2-0. Strange match. Another trophy disappears from Arsenal horizon. So much possession, but no way past VdS. Fergie selection pays off"
@TonyEvansTimes That stat that shocked me was only 10 fouls. Was that really a United-Arsenal FA Cup quarter-final?
"Millennium Stadium was/is great. Didn't propose that (or Villa, Newc, Sund, Arsenal) as I presumed distance to be a main objection"
"Jens Lehmann back to Arsenal at 41 as emergency GK cover and ""healthy"" competition with his old buddy Manuel Almunia"
@MattLawExpress It's on the wires. I'll be accused of bias if I don't tweet Arsenal injury news after tweeting United update this morning...
"@dazbentleybfc Would love to, but I'll be on way to Spurs v Arsenal. Will pass it on"
@Shazad_S Because United consistently get results when the pressure is on. Arsenal don't
"@JasonAStein There shouldn't even be a debate. He has his blind spots, but he's perfect for Arsenal"

"@samuelruback I would agree that. Must be infuriating for Arsenal fans, but I'd still warn dissenters to be careful what they wish for ..."
"@JCdaGUNNER Their protest song with obvious subtext, was simply ""Dalglish"". But Hodgson at LFC vs Wenger at Arsenal. Slight difference ..."
Confirmed #MUFC XI v Arsenal: VDS; Fabio Ferdinand Vidic Evra; Nani Carrick Anderson Park; Rooney Hernandez
"Word from the Arsenal camp is that Fabregas out after getting a ""kick on the thigh"" in training on Sat"
1-0 for Arsenal. Aaron Ramsey
"Michael Owen for Carrick. #MUFC now playing 4-2-4, with Park and Rooney the midfield two. Arsenal lead 1-0 86 mins"
@Red_Red_Devil He did. And Wenger acknowledged Arsenal lucky with Clichy/Owen too. Amazing ...
"@Red_Red_Devil So if Spurs have a top-four squad this season, where's the gatecrasher? Chelsea? City? Arsenal? United?"
"If the stats on Wilshere's season are conclusive proof of one thing, it's that Arsenal have overplayed him while knowing FA intentions"
"Nearly every Arsenal fan says ""well he's our player, we'll play him when we want"". It's true. But it also shows self-interest on both sides"
Debate always so polarised. Arsenal fans respond like I proposed melting down Herbert Chapman's bust to make a bracelet for Stuart Pearce...
@srgDCFC @garyprince @Pandaman_cometh I wasn't particularly thinking about Arsenal. Sunderland maybe. Bolton if sell Cahill. Villa ...
"@oligoldstein If you'd asked me in March, I'd have said Nasri will sign new deal with Arsenal. Far from convinced of that now"
"No need for a guessing game. Fergie is 100% referring to #MCFC when he suggests ""somewhere else"" as Nasri destination if he leaves Arsenal"
"@Blue_tintedPred @obalagun Are you suggesting we have a pro-Barca, pro-Spurs, anti-Chelsea, anti-Arsenal press? Every deal is different"
@CharlieB_gooner But do Arsenal have the players to play 4-4-2? Personally I think Walcott on right suits him and suits the team
@timpayton et al ... I know Arsenal and others (incl City) have invested in community for years. Latest MCFC project raises bar considerably

"@Trickya25 I won't overdo it, but I don't think you'd find many Arsenal fans who would refute that the next few weeks are hugely challenging"
"Right, going to bed now. Got Wenger press conf early tmrw. And, as I said 24 hrs ago, @JackWilshere added to Arsenal injury list. Not good"

"FA to study video of #NUFC v Arsenal today. Strong possibility Song charged for stamp. The brawl will also be looked at, clubs poss charged"
@dickmowbray I'd agree with the contrast (have said same myself) but Arsenal didn't have the option of both right price and right timing
"As @SamWallaceIndy writes today, Van Persie, Walcott and Song less than 2 yrs on contracts. Arsenal cannot allow repeat of Nasri situation"
"Alex Song charged by FA over Barton stamp. Newcastle and Arsenal charged with ""failing to control their players"". No action against Barton"

1-0 for Arsenal. Walcott. That should settle any nerves
Very important save by Szczesny after Asamoah ran 50+ yards with the ball. Always looked like he would save it. 28 min: Arsenal 1-0
Arsenal claim they were given permission on Mon for Wenger to communicate with bench via Boro Primorac. Uefa say that wasn't the agreement
Arsenal can expect a Uefa fine for not staging post-match press conference. Probably about the same paltry figure clubs get for racial abuse
Arsenal injuries: Gibbs and Djourou (both hamstrings) doubtful for #LFC on Sat. Wilshere already struggling. Gervinho (and prob Song) banned
@OrangSoul He has a point in that (acc to Arsenal) Uefa contradicted themselves b/w what was said on Monday and what was said on the night

Confirmed Arsenal XI v Udinese: Szczesny; Jenkinson Djourou Vermaelen Sagna; Song Frimpong; Walcott Ramsey Gervinho; Van Persie
"Anxious start for Arsenal in Udine. Good going forward, but extremely vulnerable at the back. Sagna strugglng at left back. 25 mins 0-0"
"Incredibly open game. Amazed it's 0-0 after 35 min. Gervinho excellent for Arsenal, but Udinese's midfield and attack so quick and dangerous"
1-0 for Udinese. Di Natale beautiful header. It had been coming. Now let's see what Arsenal are made of
Half-time: Udinese 1 Arsenal 0 (agg 1-1). Arsenal on the ropes
"55 min: Udinese 1 Arsenal 1 (agg 1-2). Van Persie scores after another great run from Gervinho. Huge relief for Arsenal, but can't relax"
2-1 for Arsenal! Walcott charges away down the left and finishes in style. 3-1 on aggregate now. Arsenal look safe. Relief for Wenger

"Surprising. Definitely not ""violent"" but still surprising RT @MattHughesTimes: #Arsenal win appeal re Gabriel red card. 3-game ban withdrawn"
"Arsenal awful tonight. Lots of possession & shots, but one of the worst ""without the ball"" performances I've seen from supposedly a top team"
"@g_ellis83 It's either cos I'm a rabid Chelsea-loving, Arsenal hater or cos I was at Arsenal and didn't watch Chelsea. I'll let you decide"
@Jegbie I was at Arsenal. Didn't see Chelsea game. Stop being paranoid
"@Grafollogy They have more individual talent & I'd back Arsenal to win if they played three games again. But as a team, they lack something"
"7 mins: 2-0 already for Arsenal (Sanchez and Ozil). #AFC rampant. Dreadful, dishevelled start from #MUFC."
"Full-time 3-0. Arsenal battered #MUFC like that (perhaps more so) in 1st half of this fixture last season & lost 2-1. Funny game, football."
"One of those men-against-boys nights -- except Arsenal aren't a team of kids anymore. As brilliant as Bayern are, Arsenal so poor tonight"
"Wenger admits in press conf Arsenal were ""extremely poor defensively"" & ""not at the races"".
He's right - even taking opposition into account"
"Cool finish from Kane to put Tottenham 1-0 up. Again, Arsenal offside trap not exactly remniscent of Adams and Bould at their peak"
Arsenal (especially Ozil & Sanchez) made it look so so easy tonight. Yet they've made this Champ Lge campaign look so hard. Such an odd team
About to depart for Athens with a faulty laptop and a decrepit back. Arsenal's Champions Lge prospects seem glowingly healthy by comparison
@richdodkin Thanks. I'm not too optimistic for Arsenal either
Damning of Man Utd and Arsenal that they find themselves in this predicament in the Champions Lge. Neither group looked - or looks - tough
@GoonerLiam @LeWookieGooner You're allowed to finish second -- as Arsenal know well. Finishing third in this group would be very very poor
Olympiakos v Arsenal @ Karaiskaki Stadium https://www.instagram.com/p/_FT-0KAtPa/ 
"Half-time in Athens. Arsenal 1-0 up but need another goal. Their hopes lie with Ozil, whose exquisite pass opened up defence for Giroud goal"
"Arsenal played admirably tonight. They really REALLY shouldn't have put themselves in this mess in the first place, but still that was good"
"@stueariss It was a prediction, hiding to nothing, bit of fun. Odds were against Arsenal from MD2. That's what made qualification impressive"
Finally possible to imagine #MCFC in QFs of Champs Lge after relatively kind draw (Kiev). Chelsea v PSG? Tough. Arsenal v Barcelona? Tougher
"Wow. Arsenal 2-0 up against Man City just before half-time. Ozil the provider again, this time for Giroud. Sloppy from #MCFC"
"Seen 12 goals, two excellent games, in two nights: Newcastle 3 Man Utd 3, Liverpool 3 Arsenal 3. Scoreline seemed about right in both cases"
Wenger upbeat in press conference after Arsenal concede late equaliser at Anfield. He also says Sanchez might - might - be back at weekend
"@Draexnael Outplayed them all game?Disagree. Even in Liverpool's best spell (first 20 mins), Arsenal looked dangerous"
"Van Gaal looks at TV in press room, notes that Arsenal are drawing, and suggests #MUFC are still in the title race. ""We can do it,"" he says"
FA Cup QF draw: Reading v Crystal Palace; Everton v Chelsea; Arsenal/Hull v Watford; Shrewsbury/Man Utd v West Ham
"Perspiration 0 Inspiration 2. Arsenal fans applaud their team's effort. It would be enough against most teams, but not against Messi and co"
"Was easy enough to imagine #THFC and/or #MCFC might drop points tonight. But Arsenal? At home to Swansea, from 1-0 up? That's a shocker"
"Confession: when we first launched this about 10 days ago, I had Arsenal to win it by a point. Oops. A fool's errand, but fun #prempredictor"
50 min: Watford take a 1-0 lead at Arsenal. Igahlo turns sharply to punish Arsenal's slack defending from a throw-in
WHAT A GOAL! Thunderous first-time shot from Guedioura to put Watford 2-0 up at Arsenal. Watford absolutely superb since half-time
Full time: Arsenal 1 Watford 2. Boos from the home fans. Watford fans going berserk. Brilliant win for them. Very well deserved
One win in seven matches for Arsenal. Or four wins in 14 if you prefer. It's becoming quite a disintegration

Next stop: #MCFC coaching staff. Such a good player in his Rangers & #EFC days. Arsenal never quite saw best of him https://twitter.com/DaveHytner/status/732164447687610368 …
"Yes I know he did very well for Arsenal for first few seasons. Just suggesting he was even better at Everton, where he was the main man"
"And similarly, just because he played well at Arsenal doesn't mean that they saw him the best of him"
"In part, think it's the type of player they sign. There might also a ""nearly men"" mentality. See also Arsenal of recent vintage"
Yes. Same with Arsenal - no new Adams/Vieira/Bergkamp/Henry. But it might above all be collective brittleness. Hard to cure
Exactly. Last season far more rewarding/memorable than this season for Arsenal
"Yes - and in those years there would be no need. But this year, #MUFC or #CPFC v #MCFC. 2013 Arsenal v Wigan. I like the idea"
Ha. There's a little bit of Arsenal in there too ... Thank you
"Full time: Man Utd 2 Crystal Palace 1 (aet). #MUFC first FA Cup since 2004, their 12th overall, equalling Arsenal's record"
"Re Vardy/Arsenal, would love to see #LCFC team stick together, but realistically not going to happen if players offered far more £ elsewhere"
"Yes, but £80,000 a week is Leicester's limit (currently). Arsenal could probably pay him double that."
"Certainly. A few more than United, I should think -- and certainly far fewer than Arsenal, Chelsea and others"
a) I don't think I have and b) top 4 in PL is a basic target for a club of Arsenal's resources. Iceland in Euros? Brilliant
Really pleased to see Vardy staying at #LCFC. Would be great to see that team stay together. Not convinced he would've suited Arsenal either
"No, won't pipe down. He's been excellent -- and I say that as someone who's frequently underwhelmed by him at Arsenal"
Arsenal v Liverpool. I'm expecting goals. Cue 0-0 bore draw ... @ Emirates Stadium https://www.instagram.com/p/BJFw1Y-gpam/

Wenger getting an earful (to put it mildly) from some of the Arsenal fans near the dug-out. Stewards getting involved. Not pretty. #LFC 4-2
"Press conf, Wenger puts Arsenal defeat down to:
1) Psychological blow of #LFC equaliser
2) ""Physically we're not ready yet""
3) Inexperience"
"For those asking, yes of course Wenger was asked why Arsenal are ""not ready"" yet. He cited the Euros, injuries, usual early-season rustiness"
... which is what a lot of Arsenal fans are praying Wenger will do ... .
"Looks like it was done by an Arsenal fan. One with a better sense of humour than you, presumably"
Can you give an example of how press are harsh/disrespectful to Arsenal -- and how this compares to fanbase?
And I don't think for a moment that retweeting an Arsenal fan's joke about Ramsey's haircut is disrespectful
"Wrote about it in Saturday's Times. Essentially, yes the market is utterly ludicrous, but Arsenal *have* to invest"
Leicester in the same group as Porto. Arsenal in the same group as Paris St Germain
Spurs 2-0 down now v Monaco. Lemar this time. Awful defending. The Wembley experience seems to be taking on an Arsenal-late-90s feel

Not talking about progress against rivals. Talking about measuring own progress. You say Arsenal progressed 2014-16. Let's agree to disagree
