@everymatchboy @Gingers4Limpar But he doesn't necessarily get that choice. Arsenal could hold him to contract and Real would have to bid
@arsenalaction But say Arsenal finish 5th and need to get back into champ league (worth abt £40m) - could then be false economy to sell RVP

Possible Higuain move gathers pace at Arsenal. Story here: http://bit.ly/198EbUZ 
Isco to Real also has positive knock-ons for Arsenal/Spurs. Bale bid much less likely this year and should speed up Higuain deal
"On Higuain to arsenal, deal agreed in principle with player and club. But Real stalling on signing it off b4 new manager's in place"
@MDemmayy Juve are also interested and things can always change but sense Arsenal are pretty confident
Further good news for Arsenal on Higuain - Juve have agreed a £10m deal with Man City for Tevez. Juve were in for Higuain #afc #mcfc

"Higuain's dad now quoted by media both in Spain and Argentina saying the same: ""We have permission to speak to Arsenal."" #afc"
"Almost identical transfer fees, so are Arsenal better placed by effectively trading Van Persie (30 next month) for Higuain (25)?"

Arsenal expect Luis Suarez to tell Liverpool today that he wants to leave and join them #afc #lfc
Arsenal also share apparent belief of Suarez camp that there is more to clause than simply informing him of offer #lfc #afc

Arsenal and why they must combine negotiating savvy with added wealth at this pivotal moment..#afchttp://bit.ly/1c4YdQf 
Higuain booed every time he touches the ball at Arsenal - even though he wanted to come and deal fell through over fee
Arsenal still retain an interest in Rooney...and Man U could be more willing to sell to them than Chelsea #afc #mufc #cfc
"Rooney most attracted by Chelsea, who have made the only two bids, but would consider Arsenal and is set on leaving"
Arsenal also hoping for progress on Suarez this week - they don't regard £40m+1 bid as dead yet #afc #lfc

Arsenal also looking for right-sided defender.  Miquel loan to Leicester shows confidence in Sagna option at centre-back
Rooney obviously a long shot for Arsenal but could just be feasible if Man U adopt an anybody but Chelsea stance
Arsenal seem quietly confident on Gustavo...Lars Bender was 1st choice in holding midfield but they didn't go back for Capoue
Most striking is estimated cash balance. Arsenal: £154m. Rest of PL combined: £181m. At least £70m is available for transfers

"@bigdirtyjames @Matt_Law_SM Yes, in transfer fees, but Arsenal wage bill makes it pretty even if you add it all up"
Thanks for all the feedback on earlier analysis of Arsenal's summer. Here's link for last time: http://bit.ly/16fjRxT 
Worth also saying that Arsenal still confident there'll be transfer action before end of August.
"@RedForceRising think Mourinho would agree with that - he listed arsenal '04, chelsea '05 and Man U '07 as ""magnificent"""
"Told by a good source that Mike Ashley responded to Arsenal £10.2m bid for Cabaye by saying ""which part of him do you want?"""
Told Arsenal also in for Paul Pogba. Seems to be added urgency on midfielders after Arteta/Ox injuries
"Ramsey, Rosicky and Gibbs will all travel tomorrow for Arsenal. Sagna will have a test in the morning but club are hopeful"
Ramsey's energy been the difference so far. Good start from Arsenal without creating clear chances

Loved Wenger's response tonight when asked if Mata's dad had been invited by Arsenal: “No. I don't know. Maybe.”
Arsenal don't plan to bid for Mata in this window and Chelsea won't sell but plausible to think there's a longer term game
Arsenal bench flimsy but this XI can certainly beat Spurs: Szcz Sagna Koscielny Mert Gibbs Ramsey Wilshere Walcott Rosicky Cazorla Giroud

"Arsenal focus is on strikers/midfielders now. Told there are ""lots of balls in the air"". Wonder where they will all land"
@pjbish @johncrossmirror not sure what john means...but we did discuss arsenal's transfer strategy!
"Arsenal going for Ozil, Di Maria and Abel Hernandez...back ups Ba and Draxler. Wenger seemed quite confident post-match"
Focus for Arsenal today is midfielder/strikers. Wenger happy with his defence
Transfer record fee between Arsenal and Real Madrid agreed...now down to Mesut Ozil who is in Germany.
Amazing to think Arsenal transfer record is £15m for Arshavin...would be nearly trebled for Ozil. Still down to player to agree
"Arsenal have representatives in Germany to try and tie up Ozil deal. Fee agreed, now personal terms and medical to do"
"Arsenal also now have a deal in place for Emiliano Viviano, the Palermo and Italy goalkeeper. Seen as backup to Szczesny"
"Arsenal are confident personal terms will be OK for Mesut Ozil but after summer they have had, nothing being taken for granted"
"With Mesut Ozil close to completion, Arsenal are not now pursuing Angel di Maria #afc"
"On top of Ozil and Viviano, Arsenal are chasing one other deal. Have to assume it's a striker....#AFC"
Other Arsenal target surely a striker....have been enquiries for Abel Hernandez and Demba Ba. Late bid for Suarez/Rooney anyone?
"Looking like Ozil, Viviano and Ba on season long loan for Arsenal...but still 11 hours to go #AFC"
"With Arsenal going for Ozil, Viviano and Ba, you can follow all the deadline day developments here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfers/9511033/Transfer-deadline-day-live.html …"
"Assists in last three seasons:
Ozil for Madrid/Germany: 94
Fabregas for Barca/Arsenal/Spain: 49

No incomings expected at Chelsea and it is not just Arsenal in for Demba Ba -  will depend who meets terms and what Ba wants #AFC
"Chelsea, though, have no issue letting Ba go to a rival in Arsenal. Depends purely on who meets their terms"
German newspaper Bild reporting that Ozil to Arsenal will be confirmed within an hour #AFC
@BluesChronicle Financial doping related to spending more than you earn. Arsenal have the money for Ozil from their own revenues
Ozil to Arsenal is close but doubt it will be announced within an hour. Contracts currently with lawyers #AFC
"With Mesut Ozil to Arsenal almost done, talks for Emiliano Viviano are also progressing and deal should be announced shortly #afc"
Arsenal's signing of Ozil would not only break their own transfer record but also beat the record fees of both Manchester clubs
No issues on Ozil - Arsenal putting together statement and lawyers reading and re-reading contract. It's all agreed and medical done
Demba Ba to Arsenal has fallen through. Chelsea don't want to loan to a rival. #afc #cfc
Arsenal not now expecting to add a striker. Leaves club relying heavily on Giroud to feed off Ozil's assists #afc
Nicklas Bendtner will stay at Arsenal. Suggests Wenger does see him as an option now he can't get another striker. #afc #cpfc

No doubt who the main man is at Arsenal now. Wilshere benched. Ramsey shunted right. Rosicky shunted left. Ozil centre stage
"Arsenal a blur of brilliance, as they were at Swansea for periods. A long long way to go but comparable to the best AW teams at the moment"

Ramsey and Arteta back for Arsenal tomorrow but Wilshere likely to be out with ankle injury #afc
Yesterday was a seismic moment for Arsenal - and the result of 10+yrs planning. Here's why: http://fw.to/AUIMl1F  #afc
Arsenal in contact with Schalke over Draxler but feeling at #afc is almost £40m should get you a finished product. Ozil was seen as that
Situation can change but no real expectation at Arsenal or Schalke of Draxler deal tomorrow.
"Arsenal looking to loan options, including Tello and Klose. Poss Draxler deal stalling on fee ... Story here: http://bit.ly/1loF570 "
Arsenal priority now is as much in midfield as striker after Ramsey injury/Flamini ban. Hard also to count on Ox/Wilshere given recent probs
Kim Kallstrom definitely a deal Arsenal are working on...seen as someone with experience who can provide short-term solution #afc
"Expectation is that Kim Kallstrom will be only Arsenal arrival today. Situation could, of course, change but seeming unlikely #afc"
No change at Arsenal...Kim Kallstrom to be only signing unless there are unexpected changes. No push for Klose
Arsenal's thinking goes s'thing like this (1/2): Only ever looking for a striker better than Giroud/Bendtner unless injuries changed things
Kallstrom deal imminent. Then Arsenal expect to be closed for business. No late moves for Kalou/Klose #AFC

Ozil also adamant he will deliver and won't hide at Arsenal but hopes people will understand he's in period of transition #AFC
The point is that Arsenal are very very vulnerable down their left with Podolski on the pitch. If he gets a chance though...

Interesting eve at @AST_arsenal meeting. Their analysis of accounts always worth reading. Club have £100m (fees/wages) in budget this summer
"Why are most L'pool fans on here delirious and so many Arsenal fans pessimistic? Clubs both going for title, have same points + #afc in Cup"
Arsenal's £100m transfer kitty but Wenger now expected to wait on contract. Story here: http://bit.ly/PJV69M 
"@fkhanage @AST_arsenal thanks, good to meet you. Enjoyed it"
"@GeoffArsenal @AST_arsenal It was a pleasure, I had a good evening"
Koscielny up next as Arsenal core continues to commit and Ramsey joins Ozil/Walcott among elite earners http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/10706136/Arsenal-ready-to-tie-up-Laurent-Koscielny-after-agreeing-new-deals-with-Aaron-Ramsey-and-Santi-Cazorla.html …
If any two statistics sum up the debate about Arsene Wenger and his achievements at Arsenal it is these next two...
"Before Wenger, Arsenal recorded 23 top four finishes in 92 seasons. They are about to make it 18 out of 18 under him....#Wenger1000"
Arsenal also waiting on assessment to Laurent Koscielny's calf. Came off as a precaution at half-time on Saturday
Arsenal appeal on Gibbs will be a formality. They also hope to clear Ox on grounds that shot wasn't going wide. Decision tomorrow
"6-3, 6-0. Arsenal's scores at City and Chelsea look more like a Serena Williams 1st rounder at Wim'don: Match report: http://tinyurl.com/o9q7s9l "
Rule on Ox is that has to be denying an obviou goalscoring chance. Arsenal think they have a case to say it can't be obv if it's going wide
"Aside from Matic, biggest difference between Arsenal and Chelsea was pressing of front men. Doubt Podolski would play even a minute under JM"
Arsenal have begun making contingency plans for life after Wenger - but new deal has been agreed in principle  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/10720257/Arsenal-begin-process-of-identifying-eventual-successor-to-Arsene-Wenger.html …
Arsenal still looking like a team in shock after Saturday
"Difference between arsenal now and 1st half of season is easy: no ozil, ramsey, walcott, wilshere and now koscielny but...."
"Arsenal not a ""million miles' away as Scholes claims. They are 2-3 players short. Frustration for fans is that it was the same in 2011"
"Wenger adamant that Arsenal are through their ""nightmare"" http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/10733175/Arsenal-manager-Arsene-Wenger-says-club-put-their-nightmare-behind-them-with-Manchester-City-fightback.html …"
"Also interesting poll of 8,172 Arsenal fans. Big majority (68%) want him to go on if club get top 4 again and win FA Cup but...."
"Still, despite Podolski, credit to Arsenal. After often playing best football and losing can hardly complain when they scrap a vital win...."
....and it was arsenal who knocked out 3 of the 5 best other teams in earlier rounds. Wenger could also equal post-war record of 5 wins
"Remember Mourinho when Chelsea got a series of Mike Dean decisions V Arsenal? ""They like to cry - that’s tradition."""
Arsenal target Calum Chambers...and continue summer planning in further sign Wenger intends to stay http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/10783605/Arsenal-eye-move-for-Southamptons-Calum-Chambers-with-continuing-doubts-over-future-of-Bacary-Sagna.html …
Happier mood among Arsenal fans who seemed ready for a revolt themselves 3 weeks ago. 18th straight top four finish in sight....
Arsenal still only 7 points off top of PL. Hard not to wonder what might have been with Ramsey/Ozil/Walcott/Wilshere for more of season
"Giroud's 22nd this season but reason Arsenal need new striker is simple. In 12 matches against next best 6 teams in PL, he scored 1"

Vermaelen to Barca could happen over weekend. Arsenal had always wanted players as part of deal...
Arsenal transfer priority now is centre-back rather than midfielder. Prob only one more in unless Podolski sold or a good deal comes up

Figures being quoted for Falcao..£20m for 1yr loan or £50m fee + £300k a week. He's 28 - no surprise Arsenal didn't bite
Agree Arsenal need another striker at the moment...just saying Wenger would never do a deal like that for a 28 year old
Arsenal did check on Falcao but wage demands were not deemed affordable. Live transfer window coverage here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfers/11055701/Transfer-deadline-day-live.html …
Things can change but sense at Arsenal is that likely to be quiet day. Maybe c-back cover but major striker signing looking unlikely #afc
"Yes, Arsene Wenger is involved in 'Match of Peace' in Rome today. But if Arsenal don't do major deals today that won't be the reason..."
One Arsenal deal that is close is Ignasi Miquel to Norwich. Only played 8 PL games in 3 yrs but still another c-back option to go...
"Arsenal been sounded out over Jermain Defoe, as reported by @Matt_Law_DT ..."
... But my info is that there's no interest from Arsenal in taking Defoe even on a short-term loan
"Still not expecting major incomings at Arsenal. As well as Miquel to Norwich, Arsenal likely to let Ryo Miyaichi join Feyenoord today"
"Arsenal working on one deal. Interest in Welbeck but Utd would prefer he joins Spurs. Miyaichi, Miquel and Coquelin all likely to leave"
Arsenal still in talks with Man U over Danny Welbeck and hoping to get deal done in next 2 hrs
Falcao wanted £300k a week. Not sure Arsenal fans can complain about lack of ambition on that. Just not realistic within their revenues
Arsenal agree £16m deal for Man United's Danny Welbeck. Story here: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/arsenal/11069159/Arsenal-to-sign-Danny-Welbeck-from-Manchester-United-after-agreeing-16m-transfer-of-England-striker.html …
